[[DO]] (need to fix this - turn table into actual task list)

- Feb 15, 2021 11:23 AM

    Yesterday was nice. walked 4.5 mi - rained all afternoon/evening - date night was nice!

    Spent a lot of yesterday unhappy w/ Notion. Mainly lack of offline ability. No true desktop app. Ranted a bit on Reddit. 

    Today I tried importing the Vagabondians section to Coda - ran out of 'objects' (pages) at 50. My site has almost 200. Oh well, not paying $120/year for that...

    Now raining again? Wasn't expecting that. Might be the only cloud on radar in all of Florida LOL

- Feb 13, 2021 4:32 AM

    MBAir battery - 4:32am - 86% - 6:46am - 59% - 7:31am - 48% —- after recharge - 10:16am - 100% - 

    Started a page in Research for [[Offline Mode]] - listing apps and possible replacements for offline use - not just things that have offline options, but preferably things that don't require a server. It's ok to use a server for syncing or backup, but needs to be fully usable without internet.

    Follow-up note on yesterday's tech issues - AT&T router has four bars, but still having slow ping times. Much better this morning, need to track it. Definitely slow through the OpenWRT router, so that's a problem. MacMini wifi ping times are fine, even through OpenWRT was fine at first, then just died. No DNS for [google.com](http://google.com) - connected VPN, all good. wtf? Beginning to think my router is either defective or misconfigured. Has never worked right consistently when connected to AT&T device. Maybe the AT&T router is shutting off DNS, sensing an additional device behind a device? Unsure.

    Just downloaded Craft. Pretty close to Notion for basic docs.

    Nice walk this morning, now pouring rain - squall line moving over, bit of training. Wish it would knock down some of the humidity!

- Feb 12, 2021 4:08 PM

    It is, evidently, one of those days (starting yesterday, tbh) when tech fails me at every turn. Primarily, at this point, it is centered on both my MacBook Air (spotlight, which seems to now be resolved) and internet connectivity. I have restored Travelmate to the OpenWRT router, but trying to get to the internet through it results in [Google.com](http://google.com) ping times of 500-1500ms - and I can't even open [Facebook.com](http://facebook.com) - so my project of moving Vagabondians to Notion comes to a screeching halt.

    FUCKING - HELL!!!

    I should probably work out and think about this for awhile.

    On a related note, why.......WHYYY......do I keep forgetting that anything that **requires** an internet connection will, WILL fail me! Sure, I'll eventually get back online. But if my workflow *depends* on an 'always on' scenario, it is an unworkable, unreliable workflow. 

    WHEN WILL I GET THIS??? WHEN WILL I FIX THIS???

    OFFLINE EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME!!!

    There are some pretty serious implications here. Need to dwell on this a bit...

- Feb 10, 2021 6:14 AM

    Cleaned up Twitter - reduced crypto noise to a minimum

    Running PhotoSync app on Mac Mini - this solves photo collection issue much better than Mylio I think. Remaining issue is to resolve backing it up to the cloud. Impractical without large *UPLOAD* speed/bandwidth. Not something I can ever do w/ AT&T/Verizon as is.

    Had a nice plan for watching midnight launch tomorrow from near Cape Kennedy. Unfortunately it's Speed Week at Daytone, so I guess they are going to try to get the entire country over the herd immunity hump as fast as possible. In the meantime, everything up and down the coast is completely booked. So we came back SW of Orlando to an RV park near all the Disney crap and I'm sure it will be fine. Closer to Bushnell just in case the paperwork comes in...

- Feb 9, 2021 4:41 PM

    Fairly certain I typed some things yesterday. So where did it go? 😖

    Ran the generator and engine a bit, A/C too - all good.

    Yesterday I prepped two sourdough loaves - left in fridge overnight. Baked this AM. Not bad! Didn't get enough oven spring though 😢

    Checked tires. Front were close, now both at 75-ish. Right rear are now both at 80. Left rear are 78-80, but when I tried hooking the pump to just one pair of batteries it blew a fuse. Had a replacement, but decided the tires were close enough.

    Waiting for a call back from park close to the SpaceX launch pad, hope we can get in. Called right after closing (3pm)

- Feb 7, 2021 7:33 AM

    Really? one line, that's all I logged yesterday? LOL

    NOT good sleep last night - line of thunderstorms rolling through at 90 mph, severe wx warning, TOR watch. Nothing much happened, just rain and lightning/thunder. 

    Started working on putting Vagabondians on Notion. Kinda excited actually, fun to reimagine the layout/nav part of a site with that many posts.

    Read some things about politics and crypto - yes, crypto founders were mostly hard-right libertarians. Fortunately the system they set up was mostly neutral, so current political makeup of coin holders is all across the spectrum. Slight edge to conservatives. Bitcoin holders lean right, ETH leans left. So you know where *I* am headed!

- Feb 6, 2021 4:44 AM

    more good sleep 🙂

- Feb 5, 2021 5:09 AM

    Good sleep!

    Lots of interesting derivatives out there - Mirror/MIR - Terra/UST - between these two you can get APY on holdings or actually trade a pegged derivative of certain US stocks (TSLA, AAPL, MSFT, etc.)

    Did 10 miles on bikes today 🙂

- Feb 4, 2021 8:52 AM

    I think I was awake even earlier today! But was in bed by 10pm so all good

    pre-Ordered book from Bitcoin_Vegan - Orcas - he'll send autographed copy - hope to visit his Vegan food truck in Ft. Lauderdale when we go through that area

    Things to research from Bitcoin in the Real World video conference:

    - https://strike.me
    - https://bottlepay.com
    - lifestyle tokens (cars, houses, etc.)
    - UK - negative interest!

    Set up FloridaBlue account - need to get Bryn an account, start working through wellness surveys/incentives to lower premiums

- Feb 3, 2021 4:34 AM

    up way early, not sure why. Probably too many pretzels yesterday, causes uncomfortable bloating here and there. 🤢

    now to document the crypto journey

- Feb 2, 2021 8:23 AM

    just noticed my Notion timestamps are glitching! (fixed w/ app restart)

    Fired up the 'HoneyMiner' app on my Mac Mini - we'll see how many satoshis I can stack. Might not be cost efficient when I have to pay electricity, but maybe on shorter stays at parks, or even on solar during daylight hours?

    Consolidated all crypto to BlockFi - compounding interest *plus* market gains!

    Need to write up my crypto research and put it on [glenn.thedixons.net](http://glenn.thedixons.net) - also maybe MMM journal?

- Feb 1, 2021 10:24 AM

    Nice date night last night! Made more discard sourdough pizza crackers (two trays)

    Freakin' cold front came through last night - now down into 30's a couple of nights, then maybe BELOW 30??? We're in fucking Florida!!! 😖

    Rearranged menu bar - moved everything possible to control center - combined iStat into one big menu item

- Jan 31, 2021 5:03 AM

    Found a couple of small $10 signup bonuses, but not much out there right now. I guess the inflow has been high lately so incentives aren't needed as much? This is my crypto exchange/wallet tracker

    [](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/00c76e14-ebce-4a15-95f6-4d65dbdbc59a/crypto.numbers)

- Jan 30, 2021 9:04 AM

    So - wire finally went through, account funded. Used half for BTC, half for ETH. Opened up an ETH wallet (myEtherWallet) and put $10 in mainly to use for AirDrops - opened up another wallet on Celsius for BTC, transferred $240 to it - referral code should give me another $20, if I hold for 30 days I'll get another $30 from promo code. 

    Theoretically, according to the conventional wisdom, you should never *hodl* your coin inside a custodial wallet, like in an exchange. So I will move everything to wallets. Guess I should see if any other wallets (like MEW) have any rewards?

- Jan 29, 2021 6:39 AM

    As great as Gemini is, their funding method limitations are killing me. I'm sure their reasons are good (I hope) but it puts me in a Catch 22. I can only wire from my trading account. The only options on their end for *receiving* a wire is to receive from a checking or savings account. They accepted my debit card, but I can't fund my account from it so I'm not sure why I would bother...

    Schwab says my wire from yesterday (right after 4pm) completed this morning just before 6am. Gemini says that if the wire doesn't come in as a same-day wire, it will never show up and will bounce back to Schwab within 4 days. wtf?

- Jan 28, 2021 11:52 AM

    BB and AMC down today after they and GME and NOK were all halted or blocked from apps. RobinHood cancelled transactions, on CashApp they are stuck in 'pending' state. Can't cancel, yet. So - moving any sort of 'play' money to Gemini for blockchain/crypto currency, starting with 'stable' coins. Money to use:

    - $142 (AppleCard Cashback)
    - $200 (CashApp balance)
    - $200 (retracted from RobinHood)
    - 
- Jan 27, 2021 5:35 PM

    Decided to get in on some of the Reddit market fun - bought a few BB and AMC shares today. Already up nicely. $ is not significant. Need to do more!

    Wired up the new batteries today. I *think* I have it all set up right. Had a brief short-circuit moment, screamed like a 6th grade choir soprano. LOL

    Picked up top battery hold-down bolt and some tape in Bushnell today. Also got license plates for the car - paid over phone, picked 'em up, installed

- Jan 26, 2021 5:14 AM

    Did find a Riley McDaniel in the area of the Petersons (same County) when he was a kid. Nothing after that, so not sure if it matches Mom's stories she collected. But it could be that, instead of incest. Still doesn't explain why family put Ben W Peterson as James' father if it wasn't true...

- Jan 25, 2021 6:07 AM

    Checked battery health yesterday - found one negative cable that wasn't tight - moved the charger's temperature probe to *underneath* the negative cable, tightened it all up. Water levels were fine, topped up a few cells. Amazingly, the hygrometer showed all cells in green or better? Kinda surprised at that.

    Made executive decision last night - fuck this piece of shit Pi 4, I'm going back to the Mac Mini. Can still use old Pi for Pi-hole and even music streaming if and when needed, like when batteries are low. (idea - find audio cable y-splitter and connect both Mac and Pi to one cable running to speaker - older Pi does not have bluetooth built in)

    Mac Mini is finishing Big Sur install this morning.

    Jan 25, 2021 7:34 PM Found a lot of info linking Lucy Ann Moss Peterson to her family - still can't find Moss/Dover connection.

    Battery cables arrived!

- Jan 24, 2021 1:56 PM

    Friday I picked up the wood panel from Lowe's (2x2) and battery trays plus bolts from Napa. Forgot to get the little bar the goes across the top of the batteries *doh!*

    Installed the wood panel, moved the monitor block, fuse and inverter up onto it. Ready to attach everything, but need lag bolts for the trays too...

    Saturday it rained most of the morning and afternoon. Just chilled and worked on genealogy.

    Just reflashed the SD card for the Pi - finishing updates, will see if that fixes the whole freezing up thing...

    Ethernet dies pretty quick if the usb hub is plugged in! wtf?

    Another wonderful date night :)

- Jan 21, 2021 6:17 AM

    Fairly frustrated w/ Genealogy today. WikiTree is great until someone else fills a bio full of miscellaneous crap. Worse if they add non-existent siblings or children, or if they try to add very speculative, unproven data. The only reason WikiTree hasn't turned into a steaming pile of crap like FamilySearch, Geni or Ancestry is that it's a little more difficult to figure out. GEDCOM imports though, pretty easy. And they almost killed WikiTree.

    MacFamilyTree is pretty, but you can't bulk add sources. Frustrating.

    Notion is nice, but date fields are tricky and I haven't fully wrapped my brain around databases and rollups, etc. Others seem to be working on additional solutions, so maybe?

    Jan 21, 2021 7:28 AM Damn - the more I futz with it, the more I see problems in trying to use Notion for genealogy, at least for any reasonable way of displaying and traversing a family tree. Oh well...

    Jan 21, 2021 2:04 PM Testing Gramps. Not going to win any beauty prizes, but has plugins and can theoretically download all images referenced on WikiTree. *that* would be big, currently getting an error so will have to wait for my spam status to be reviewed on Gramps Discourse and then ask about it.

    Able to drag things into individual records and event galleries, not source citations tho...waiting for more feedback.

    Got battery cables ordered - need to get wood panel from Lowe's and battery trays from some auto parts place...will do that in the morning.

- Jan 20, 2021 5:49 AM

    For some reason I started this this morning, but never actually typed anything. Updated several things, mainly genealogy. Watched Biden/Harris inauguration. Feels so nice!

- Jan 19, 2021 8:28 PM

    And I skipped a day. Was busy working on genealogy stuff, then we showered, I shaved, we had date night. It was a very nice date night!

    This morning we did the bike ride w/ the locals - almost 14 miles! Many things are sore.

- Jan 17, 2021 5:34 AM

    There is a willingness to be violent in self-defense, and then there is a mentality that seems to *relish* violence, to seek it out. I have no desire for that, so I'm backing off from a large portion of the antifa world. Much more interested in doxxing, shaming, etc. Changed my Twitter background and avatar, also my 'name' space and profile. Updated to more reasonable humanism and anti-racism focus. 

- Jan 16, 2021 6:31 AM

    Forms dropped off - all good, will call us for payment info next week, should have in-hand by Friday!

    Decided to hold off on nazi-hunting for now. Reasons:

    1. Unclear on workflow
    2. Unclear on who needs what help
    3. Horrible, unreliable internet here

    In the meantime, will remain vigilant and alert for opportunities. Need to photograph any other 

    Yesterday got back into genealogy work - started reproducing the Patterson History houses on my site, at least the Quaker-related ones.

- Jan 15, 2021 7:05 AM

    I am typing this for my friend Laura who I miss very much 😢

    And she liked my screenshot! 😂

    Today we drop off vehicle registration forms. Hopefully by the end of next week we can have the plates in hand.

- Jan 14, 2021 10:21 AM

    Think I have all the docs we need - Proof of Insurance forms from Progressive show the new address, plus Letter and signup form from Escapees. SS cards. Passports. Hope that's enough for the driver's licenses!

    Got driver's licenses! Finished vehicle registration paperwork, including having a traffic cop from Sheriff's office come out and verify VIN #'s - he also called in the plates as part of this process. Good thing we didn't have any warrants out jaja

    Will drop off papers tomorrow.

- Jan 13, 2021 5:21 AM

    Epiphany from the last couple of days - I may have found something I can consider my 'purpose' in life. It gives me that general 'sense of purpose' as well as a sort of hobby, while also helping me justify staying in the U.S. on a longer-term basis as our 'home base': Anti-fascism

    More specifically, helping track down and document (publicly) fascists of all stripes - white supremacists, racists, alt-right, OathKeepers, Proud Boys, Qanon idiots, American Identitarisans, antisemites, etc. Current focus will be on everyone who breached the Capitol building on January 6, 2021. This overlaps with a whole lot of Trump supporters. 

    Yesterday made appointments w/ DMV for Thursday (tomorrow!) - hopefully can get driver's licenses w/ current documentation - if not, will have to get more.

    Spent way too much time online reading Twitter - also did collect more info and photos from Mega to go through

- Jan 12, 2021 12:07 PM

    Got signed up for FloridaBlue cheapest plan, $137/mo. Still need to set up payment and provide verification of address. Plus verification of income.

    Used Progressive cover letter for RV to prove address, uploaded Bryn's income verification. They haven't asked for mine, guess if they need it I'll submit later?

- Jan 11, 2021 7:37 PM

    Transferred car insurance to Progressive - changed car and RV to Florida address. Printed proof of insurance for both. Started ACA quote for FL - probably need to call BlueSelect about where I can actually *use* said insurance.

- Jan 10, 2021 6:23 AM

    Just discovered a couple of specific things about...

    Jan 10, 2021 6:53 PM well, I have NO IDEA what 'specific things' I discovered this morning - not sure why I stopped typing either LOL

    Made it to Sumter Oaks park - paid for the rest of the month, got settled in, leveled, connected. Did a walk around the park. Saw a rookery of great white herons out in the cypress swamp - saw some white ibises in one lot near the front! Heard a few other interesting bird sounds out there, maybe we'll see more tomorrow.

    Downloading Season 1 of Schitt's Creek - 1st episode unwatchable so far - possibly problem w/ Pi? 

- Jan 9, 2021 8:25 AM

    Got my [glenn.thedixons.net](http://glenn.thedixons.net) subdomain pointed at my Notion [[Digital Glenn]] page - seems to be working - need to rearrange a bit, probably use less toggles (endpoint links should open separate page?) - use breadcrumbs for navigation, or maybe tags?

    Idea - use website change log at bottom, way to track updates in addition to anything inside pages - I mean, it's an *evergreen* site so this would document the entire purpose/direction of the site - an everchanging/evergreen site. Example: 

    [SamadliCom | Business Development | Tech | Experiments](https://samadli.com/)

    Also got plain old [thedixons.net](http://thedixons.net) pointed at my Notion [[The Dixons]] page - added cover images to all pages on both sites. 

    Cold here at the Old Pavilion RV park - nice views on the water, but mostly cold and windy. Supposedly 33-35 for tonight's low. Headed to Sumter Oak Escapees park in the morning! 2.5 hour drive time, probably take us 3.5-4

- Jan 8, 2021 5:00 AM

     Perfectly lovely date night last night. Perfect ending to a very nice day. 

    Philip said Mom and Dad got vaccinated yesterday. So this is the beginning of the end.

- Jan 7, 2021 8:34 AM

    Got distracted by yesterday's MAGAT riots in D.C. The end result is that a good chunk of Republicans were actually worried enough to distance themselves from him and the electoral votes were quickly approved. Trump even actually said there would be an orderly transition on Jan. 20. As bad as it was, I'm hopeful the future furor will be confined to the GOP - let them deal with the fallout of worshipping at his feet for five years. I think it will largely tear them up and chase maybe 5-10% away for the long term. Maybe split along centrist/MAGA lines. Who knows. Tired of thinking about this shit.

    So yeah, on one hand I'm just another day older than yesterday. And I still, after six decades, can't wrap my brain around the milestone nature of years vs age. I have *completed* 60 years, even though until yesterday I only referred to myself as '59' - now I'm officially '60' but I'm on day one of my 61st revolution around the sun. Not sure why that concept is so hard to tackle. I'm in year 61. I've completed 60. But I am '60' years old. *sigh*

    OK, maybe typing 60 a lot will help me get used to it. I'm still not used to it being 2021!

    Jan 7, 2021 6:53 PM time for dinner/wine w/ my hunny! Fried oysters and sweet potato fries!

    ![[Productivity%20Journal%2045df08a67bc1412787ae90fbc816e610 5BBB3A3C-7E52-40B3-A248-2EC6D61D5C0D.jpeg]]

    And had chocolate cake earlier 

    ![[Productivity%20Journal%2045df08a67bc1412787ae90fbc816e610 CE59CAB8-3162-4DA2-BB57-7FBC0E4A8DE6.jpeg]]

- Jan 6, 2021 6:20 AM

    So I didn't forget how to add a journal entry here, cool! Thoughts on Notion vs TiddlyWiki:

    - I feel like I prefer an app vs browser. Reasons:
        - Browsers are yet another dependency - updates and extensions are always unknowns when troubleshooting
        - Even though Notion might be somewhat in a browser, it's a version forked and controlled by Notion
        - Running TW in browser requires something running a local server, which adds another layer of complexity, either:
            - TiddlyDesktop (lots of crashes)
            - Bob's server - have to keep it running via a terminal command
            - WebDav - seemed to not work last time I tried it
            - Node.js - not sure if Bob's thing uses node or not, and I want it to, but want to control node myself
        - In TW I have found it easy to create a glitch whereby the page renders incompletely or not at all
        - In TW it is also easy to screw something up and lose recent edits when you have to refresh
        - Embedded previews and capturing entire web pages are trivial in Notion, almost impossible in TW
        - Main remaining negative for Notion is extremely limited offline mode. I can run TW all day w/out internet
            - Need workaround for this? Supposedly coming soon, so...
        - I have to say it feels much easier to type journal notes here - for one thing, the content doesn't go off-screen while typing.

    Need to do something about to-read list. Workflow ideas:

    - On capture (with webclipper or manual) need to make sure and note source of material (how I found out about it) and reason that it captured my attention. That way maybe I don't have to read the entire piece?
        - Just found a better (?) clipper for Notion - universal [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/universal-web-clipper/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/universal-web-clipper/)
    - Need to keep non-books in a separate database table since there are very few columns that apply - just author and notes really

    Finished quick run-through of Articles to read - added tags - separated them from Books

- Dec 15, 2020 5:59 AM (CST)

    Reading about news (from David @ Raptitude) and got to thinking and then had this bit of epiphany:

    > Amish, Mennonite, Hasidic Jew, Pentecostal - these groups all dress in such a way that their religious identity is known to anyone who sees them. We think of them as quaint, as throwbacks, generally harmless, oddities. We don't fear them. But we think differently about Sikhs, Muslims, etc. Partly this is from the association w/ extremist activism and/or violence. I assume our view of Mennonites would change if they were producing occasional bombers.

    Gasquatch working ok this AM. Rebooted last night, but internet was SLOW - also forgot that I had a torrent download in progress ☹️ (finished overnight

    *REALLY* need to get parts and bolt down the recliners. Also need to list Mac Mini on eBay or FB selling group maybe? Also need to go get batteries from Sam's Club?

    Instead I've now spent hours researching note-taking workflows and publishing options. All so I can save ONE. DAMNED. SENTENCE. from something I'm reading online *facepalm*

- Dec 14, 2020 5:24 AM (CST)

    6-6.5 hours of sleep, including a brief snooze in the recliner after 9pm.

    Gasquatch disconnected - gateway unreachable - had to reboot *both* devices. Changed static lease back to 1 hour.

    Time to workout while the gang does outdoors aerobics - then a walk.

    So evidently Kim and Craig are much more conservative than we thought - his dad was a cop, she conceal carries (and I presume he does too).

- Dec 13, 2020 3:51 AM (CST)

    Asleep by 9:30-10 - awake at 3:30 *ugh*

    This time it was snacks and liquor - mainly samples from Specs.

    Had nice nap in recliner - weird position, but good 30 minutes.

    This morning Gasquatch router is still connected to the internet! Unfortunately the internet is a bit sluggish with latency, but at least the port is live and active. Update: still disconnecting randomly 🤢

    Broke down the cardboard boxes that the recliners shipped in, put in dumpster. Inside ever since. Rained a lot, now windy and gusty outside.

- Dec 12, 2020 6:39 AM (CST)

    Crashed *not* so early - I blame Kim. Lots of chocolatey vodka. Fun painting. Girl time. Nancy even said I'm like one of the girls. Not sure how to take that, exacly. LOL

    Spent most of this morning futzing around with router. *finally* connected/reconnected and hopefully won't need to change this again. AT&T device assigning router to static IP, but router WAN port set to DHCP. It's working. *shrug*

    Going to call Home Depot since I haven't received a pick-up email confirmation - both chairs have arrived! (via phone, confirmed ready for pickup)

    Gary and Patty stopped by as we were replacing the awning arm - kinda needed an extra hand any way, so this was nice! Awning is out and finally has a chance to dry some.

    Picked up recliners - they're nice! Will bolt them down in the next day or two.

- Dec 11, 2020 5:26 AM (CST)

    crashed *early* last night - asleep by 9:20 or so. 7 hours of sleep = up by 4:30 *ugh*

     When it comes to the internet, any time it goes out I can switch to the AT&T wifi and it is still on the internet. So it's just the router and it's ethernet connection. Pinpointing which end of the CAT6 cable is the problem is the tricky part.

    Got most of the epub books copied up. Upload speeds *extremely* slow. 0.11mbps. 

    In the never-ending troubleshooting, I have now disabled ipv6 on WAN and deleted the WAN6 port. Internet connectivity came back up w/out a reboot! Promising? We'll see...

    ping ran for an hour, no drops! (later, it went dead again) - but now it's back online and I don't remember if I rebooted again or not...

    Disassembled jackknife sofa - all fit in the car! - will attempt to deliver to Habitat for Humanity in Livingston - if they won't take it, then Goodwill (Habitat took it!)

    Now raining. 

- Dec 10, 2020 8:44 AM (CST)

    Yesterday got FileRun set up - this morning started uploading ebooks as a first test

    still having issues w/ internet disconnecting between the AT&T device and the router - and still not sure which device is causing it. Worse still, the only way to resolve it that I've found is to reboot *both* devices! Only one doesn't resolve it. Maybe it's TTL? (researching) - can always connect direct to AT&T wireless box and internet is fine. But router is now getting disconnected within 5 minutes. *REALLY* not sure why. Also, *really* pissed!

    Got propane this morning - 8 gallons! Still worth the exorbitant $4/gal price to not have to pack up and drive into town...

    Bryn out for a walk - I'm waiting for awning arm delivery. Found out it might not have left the DFW area yet, but did not get dressed and try to find the walkers. I'll walk later. When it's not freezing...

- Dec 8, 2020 6:02 AM (CST)

    last night also got tired of constant issues w/ OpenWRT - took the drastic step of resetting it. Couldn't get back in until this morning when I realized there was a separate button to turn wifi on/off and after the reset it defaulted to off. Now have it back up and running and internet is working. Not adding *any* software until I can verify that the setup and internet connection is stable. Will then add Travelmate back in and see if I can get it set up better...

    Accidentally started today's notes inside yesterday's (I think)

    After an hour or so (maybe more?) finally seem to have things routed correctly. DNS requests hit router, directed to pi-hole, which has PIA's DNS servers set as upstream. So the DNS request then goes *back* to the router, through the VPN connection, to PIA. DNS Leak Test is *crawling* which maybe means it is working? Not sure.

    update - it works! Also haven't lost internet in an hour or two, so that seems fixed?

    NOTE: IT WASN'T - AT&T dropped connection to NetComm IFWA-40 router. Starting to get pretty damned pissed about all this!

    Decided to go ahead and download/install Big Sur - not sure if this was a great idea. 12+GB 🤢

    Download completed - time for reboot 😱 

    So far so good - desktop background did not auto-switch to Big Sur, so I did that manually

    Got tired of problems w/ Contabo server - Yunohost install took over all other installations at root, and was not located anywhere at /var/www/html so installing anything else was major pain. Finally just wiped it all and installed Ubuntu 20.04 instead of Debian. Will try for FileRun install next.

    Setting things up on new Ubuntu instance

    MYSQL

    db = filerun

    user = filerun

    pw = 9853flie

    FileRun info:

    user = superuser

    pw = 1c75a43994f3

    Every day, sometimes multiple times per day, the Netgear router loses connection to the AT&T device. Restarting the br-lan interface doesn't resolve it, rebooting the router does nothing. Rebooting the AT&T device fixes it. 🤢

    Got PIA set up on OpenWRT router - need to make sure pi-hole is still part of the mix tho...

    So Tenet was from Christopher Nolan. I really should put him on my list of people who's movies I just won't watch. Like Terrence Malick. Nolan's are better, but they just try to do too much. I'd totally watch a series based on them though, because then they could take their time developing everything. Instead, he crams hours and hours of plot points into 2.5 hours and it is crazy confusing. 

    I *think* I finally have the Netgear router reset to where it can get an IP from the AT&T device (via ethernet) and send that out to other devices via WiFi. Phone won't work using the internal VPN thing, save that for when on Verizon only. Turned the original Pi back on to make sure the pi-hole part still works...

    Moved calorie counting to Google Sheets - used data validation and vlookups w/ 'iferror'

    [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jMPfIJ6Xtx9SMPspGFoF0oymdWZLJ2PJfwyQ8LzZkUU/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jMPfIJ6Xtx9SMPspGFoF0oymdWZLJ2PJfwyQ8LzZkUU/edit?usp=sharing)

    very fun happy hour - spiked rum/fruit drinks - now eating tofu scramble and watching Tenet

- Dec 3, 2020 5:06 AM (CST)

    Just realized my monthly account update script didn't run on Tuesday! Need to do that right now.

    Market way up last month. Added chart to monthly balances - it looks very nice! Also had to hide TCDRS row and remove it from the formula since they are no longer reporting balances to me, just how much I'm going to receive monthly. Chart now consistent over last two years. Still looks good!

    ![[Productivity Journal/12-1-20-Account-Balances.png]]

    Also had credit limit increases at Apple and Good Sam's - extra 6500 of emergency funding I guess...

    Finished watching The Undoing tonight - very nice plot! 

- Dec 2, 2020 8:22 AM (CST)

    Well, pretty sure I already typed some things in here for today's notes, but I don't see them anywhere. Probably deleted them while testing using a database instead of toggle notes. Or maybe I just imagined it? *shrug*

    Also could have *sworn* I made notes yesterday, but evidently not. Big hike day kinda fizzled. We wandered around Double Lake area, but trails were mostly in the trees, frequented mostly by mountain bikes. Not much scenery, and so narrow that you couldn't talk to anyone unless you were very close, so I was kicking myself for not bringing my airpods ☹️

    Read an article in Outdoors Online about Good Catch, plant-based seafood! Good to know that whole area is growing, lots of venture capital coming in, as well as investments from existing seafood companies. 

    Another long rainy day - should clear out tonight, then slowly warm up over the next several days. You'd never know we were in southeast Texas deep in the piney woods...

    Ordered recliners from Home Depot! Also ordered replacement arm for awning (on eBay) - white this time!

    Re-reading some things on Humanism, Buddhism, etc.

- Nov 30, 2020 5:47 AM (CST)

    Two competing theories on how best to deal with tonight's big freeze (30)

    1. Fill the fresh water tank, drain and stow the hose (what we would usually do)
    2. Open the gray water drain, run water through kitchen sink all night

    If it gets colder longer, you have to do #1, otherwise 2 should be fine. I hope.

    Spent a few hours yesterday fixing ebooks. Used bash script to bulk convert. Evidently, once an epub has been in the Books app, it is packaged differently and won't open right in Calibre. So the script opened each one as a package, zipped the contents, moved the zipped file back to the main directory, then renamed it. Then I deleted the old packaged version, renamed the files back to proper names, etc. Now down to 82 books, copied up to SeaFile. This morning I'll make sure all the books in the Books app have a copy in SeaFile.

    Official email from park - fill the tank, stow the hose. So we did. Also ran the generator for five minutes, probably overdue. Now to download episode 11, season 4 finale of Fargo. It was a big ending. Saw one of the twists coming, not the other! 

    Took a different sort of political-compass-style test - very centrist! w/ a Progressive lean, I guess.

    Finished my pension application yesterday - should get my first check end of February!

    Got an email from USPS - evidently my old daily email w/ scans was under the User ID of dixonge61 - don't even remember using that one! So when I get a copy of my validation # from Philip, I should be able to get an early warning of each day's mail before Escapees updates me. On the other hand, a previous attempt to set this up told me that my current zip code doesn't allow it, meaning there's no scanning of envelope covers going on locally. We'll see...

    Ready to order two recliners from Home Depot, but need to wait until Dec. 1 just to push the extra cash outlay off until the end of January. Also need to figure out wth to do with the existing sofa!

    Update: mentioned the sofa on the Escapees Winter hangout group on Facebook - someone else is replacing their recliner love seat! Possible trade in the works, will do a 'meet-n-peek' on Tuesday.

- Nov 28, 2020 5:54 PM (CST)

    Somehow thought I had typed a lot of notes today, but evidently that was just yesterday?

    Finished more photo dedupes today. Ready to use it on external drive, the main batch.

    Did many calculations today. Finally determined actual income and taxes for next year, taking into account HSA contributions. Also verified the impact on ACA income and premium subsidies / tax credits. Looks like a nice HSA-eligible national plan will cost us around $120/month. HSA will save us $720 or so per year and, since it lowers our taxable income, about $100 per month on insurance premiums.

    Decided *not* to recreate the entire Patterson History site. If *they* can't be bothered, then that's on them. But I did save a copy of the entire site and will eventually incorporate all information on the Dixon homes, including any video he made, into *my* site (thedixons.net)

- Nov 27, 2020 5:38 AM (CST)

    Most of yesterday's notes were about process/procedure re: photos. Need to move or copy one section out to actually *track* progress.

    Waylaid by an email from a WikiTree relative. Problem w/ Patterson History Project link. Good reason - no such domain name! wtf? Found a copy under an IP address (also on archive.org) - everything now downloaded but internal links to videos not working. Not sure why. Need to try and contact Edwin Patterson and also probably need to put the site up somewhere, or link to an archive copy. Looks like the site was hacked somewhere in early 2019. Ended up using wget - had to rename movie files, but still not embedded because of something w/ javascript - evidently the site was built in iWeb! Ancient tech.

    Back to photos - auto-dedupe tools have one major issue - if dupes are mainly because of duped folders, which folder of photos should be kept? If one is deleted, where is the one that is kept? Even if deleted dupes are all correct, where are the remaining files, and are they in a proper hierarchical, sensible, logical folder structure? After finding two folders w/ dupes, it seems easier to process just those two, then merge them, then make sure the folder is in the right spot. Then the next two folders. And you might need to rescan at the end to make sure your newly merged folder doesn't have a 3rd folder dupe/clone somewhere out there! Odd that this hasn't been addressed by some easy-to-use GUI-based app out there...

    Update: [Duplicate File Finder](https://nektony.com/duplicate-finder-free) ! Seems to work pretty well. Automates just enough, not hard to move through a few folders at a time. Can merge! Using the MacBook Air drive as a workflow test before moving on to the mega-drive. Will just hook the MediaFiles drive to the Mac I think, then after I finish hook it back up to the Pi and start syncing up to the server a bit at a time.

- Nov 26, 2020 6:02 AM (CST)

    So PhotoPrism doesn't monitor a folder for changes. PhotoStructure will be adding the ability to watch a folder in the near future. Once that is in place, the workflow *could* be like this:

    1. Take photo on iPhone
    2. PhotoSync copies it to the Pi's external drive via SMB
    3. PhotoStructure sees it and imports it

    Except.....that's where things kinda break down. So maybe it's done differently? For example:

    1. Take photo on iPhone
    2. [PhotoSync](https://www.photosync-app.com/home.html) copies it to the Pi's external drive via SMB
    3. The following organizational steps need to be done in manageable chunks. Need to decide an order (newest to oldest?)
        1. Dedupe photos (existing, probably un-needed for new photos) ([dupeguru](https://dupeguru.voltaicideas.net/)?)
        2. Dedupe all other files ([periscope](https://github.com/anishathalye/periscope)?)
        3. Rename files/folders by date/place etc.
        4. Ensure metadata is up to date
        5. Generate smaller images for syncing to server ([SyncThing](https://syncthing.net/))
        6. BACKUPS! ([Borg](https://www.borgbackup.org/)?)
    4. This should produce a final copy for local use/consumption. Any viewing or sharing would use the full-sized file.
    5. Server would be used for viewing/sharing online. Needs to produce a smaller version for each image for mobile.

    Watched 'Carol' w/ Cate Blanchett. Fairly arousing sex scene, which is stupid since it was two lesbians but that's what porn has done to me. LOL Interesting history of the author, who also wrote Stranger on a Train and the 'Ripley' series. Lots of her works have been adapted to movies and TV and stage.

    Also walked this morning - did the 'Gobble Wobble' - donated $40 to CARE (Escapees program). I hope at least *some* of the CARE residents aren't raving Trumpists. Got a 'dangle'! Also sent some video clips of Reno 911 to Nancy Matelli (group leader) to explain why the word dangle makes me chuckle.

- Nov 25, 2020 4:36 PM (CST)

    Well, I guess it was inevitable - I skipped a day! Got too focused-in on making the photo workflow work, I guess.

    Yesterday we hiked out east of town, 5.4 miles I think. Good, long hike, long while since I did that many miles. Overdue.

    I did finally get SyncThing up and running. Now trying to figure out at which stage to do photo processing. Probably best to do it here locally, then copy up final preview images (sized for reasonable viewing, not full size) - helps with data caps. THEN - on the server - run PhotoPrism? Need to test this out.

- Nov 23, 2020 9:20 PM (CST)

    Wow - very late for my first entry!

    Saw a movie last night - w/ the group. Helen Mirren + Donald Sutherland - alzheimer's and terminal cancer - one last joyride - in an RV. End of movie they did a double-suicide in it. Not as depressing as it sounds, really.

    Got mail forwarding set up today - have official addresses in both Texas and Florida now. 

- Nov 22, 2020 8:47 AM (CST)

    Going a bit crazy w/ email cleanup. Working through backlog in [Outlook.com](http://outlook.com) - changing emails/passwords - unsubscribing, etc. Inbox 1!

    so far Docker experiment is less than ideal. Desktop client Dockerstation was a bust - will probably just work on server directly, although the first couple of installation attempts (lazylibrary, etc.) don't seem to run properly, so unsure at this point

- Nov 21, 2020 8:20 PM (CST)

    Seafile working out! (so far) - but AT&T is sporadic.

    Had nice time last night - love-making after the happy hour - bit more wine

    Downloaded Docker - going to experiment with it vs YunoHost

    More Mandalorian, Fargo in torrent queue, but downloading is crawling!

- Nov 20, 2020 6:10 AM (CST)

    Got really tired of NextCloud photos app - unable to block ebooks folder from being imported - uninstalled NextCloud and Piwigo - currently testing Seafile 

    Time to shower/shave in prep for happy hour 😎

- Nov 18, 2020 7:48 AM (CST)

    The ebooks are out of control. Some are on my laptop, some are on my phone. iCloud does not seem to want to sync these, since I didn't buy them from them. Need a better solution for this. In addition, the *reading* is out of control. I start and stop books on a whim, and I still am unorganized about taking notes, so what I read and when is very random. I should read books in the mornings. Instead I stimulate my brain cells by opening the 'direhose' and checking out the latest news and Twitter. These are things I *intended* to stop and yet restarted basically due to the election and the resulting Trump idiocy. At this point I need to disengage again until he concedes.

    Continued setup of NextCloud - began syncing items, including ebooks! Installed desktop and iPhone apps.

- Nov 17, 2020 7:05 AM (CST)

    Nice being on shore power. Stop worrying about lights and even heat. Gas is a bit low, but just discovered that they have gas trucks come through for motorhomes once or twice a week! So we won't have to drive away, also nice.

    Met the rest of the winter home group today, the ones who are here so far. They include a guy who made/sold conservative flags and holders on the roadside. One of the first activities discussed was making care packages for veterans. So basically the entire Escapees organization is mostly older retired white people so of *course* they are mostly Trump fans. The flags and signs around the park, two weeks after he lost the election, are telling. I guess I need to re-examine the Xscapers again?

- Nov 16, 2020 7:12 AM (CST)

    Re: photos - ended up firing up a VPS! Installed YunoHost, a sort of admin panel app, but open source. Used it to install Piwigo (for photos) and NextCloud (for docs/files). Cost around $50-60/year for the VPS. 300GB. Basically rolling my own Flickr and iCloud Drive all in one spot. No, it's not something that easily fits into my recent 'simplification' philosophy, where everything *just works* for Bryn even if I were to keel over. But it also has to work *now* - for both of us. And if I'm here on this earth for another 40 years and have to put up with companies pulling the rug out from under me for four decades, then would life really be worth living? 🤔 Also need to determine whether or not oDrive can provide a bridge by connecting all the existing things out there (Google Drive, iCloud, Dropbox, etc.) until I can consolidate.

    Signed up w/ Fastmail - using email aliases for anything that isn't direct communication w/ another person (which is, frankly, 95% of all my emails). Diversifying and obfuscating by not having every single internet account use the same damned email address. That plus making all my passwords five-word phrases feels like the right thing to do. Also moved passwords over to 1Password. Still working out some workflow kinks, but so far it seems like a good move. And it works on the Pi. I still like the chat layout from the Spike email app. I guess now that I have Fastmail connected to the IMAP of [posteo.de](http://posteo.de) maybe I need to disconnect Spike from posteo and connect to the IMAP servers of Fastmail? [done!]

    Enjoyed the visit w/ Lois - was unable to introduce her to Spike, but we had a good chat. Got to hear an inside scoop from someone of color who is also gay, including her mom and Aunt that somehow like Trump!  Her perception of the GOP and the very real dangers it represents to her.

    Below 40 this morning - and somehow the batteries never recharged all the way, so using the house batteries to fire up the furnace. Will be nice to do full hookups again today as we begin our 6-week 'home base' winter thing w/ the Escapees. I may burn any Trump flags I see...

    Cleaned up all tabs on Safari on my phone, saved the articles to Notion. Probably need to wrap up my political reading for awhile...

    Batteries fully charged today, kept them on while driving. Drive to Rainbow's End seemed to take SO. LONG. Got here around 4:30, minor leveling, all utilities hooked up easy. Had to dump grey/black tanks. Drained fresh water tank while on the road, just to make sure the icky taste from Tiny T is all out. Probably should run some extra water through it to rinse it out.

    As we were checking in, Bryn talked to some lady outside the office. She said she was leaving, tired of the non-mask-wearers.

- Nov 15, 2020 7:34 AM (CST)

    Cold front came through - initially forecast around midnight, woke up at 4am to cool winds and gusts. It was a little over six hours of sleep, so I got up and shut everything down, made hot water, etc. Bryn was up by 5am!

    Lois is supposed to visit today, should be fun. Hope to introduce her to Spike! They both seem to know *everyone* so it only seems fitting that they meet (imho)

    Flickr pulled a fast one on me. I *thought* I had set things up for my Pro subscription to just expire, but instead it switched to monthly. That's $7/month or $84 a year! Need to do a quick comparison and figure out what to do now that Google Photos is getting rid of their free tier. So freakin' complicated 🤢

- Nov 14, 2020 4:19 PM (CST)

    Today - we cleaned the final side (passenger) of the RV - touched up the front - about as clean as it's going to get I guess.

    Wedding today at Tiny T - breezy, gusty, partly cloudy. The batteries jumped from 82% to 100% in-between checks. Hopefully a normal sync behavior, vs some sort of bad settings. I guess we'll see. At least for now can charge some things.

    Got the bikes out yesterday, did a section of trails near downtown Austin, had lunch at Counter Culture. So delicious! Ate on the patio. Bikes working well. Bought two rear racks which can also substitute as rear fenders (maybe prevent mud stripes down our backs).

- Nov 13, 2020 6:46 AM (CST)

    Probably had less caffeine yesterday, mainly because we were out and about. Result was I was tired and asleep by 9:45pm. As Bryn warned, I was up by 4am. Ugh. Yesterday also involved extra calories from kolaches and scones. Somehow we managed to offset those calories by not having normal snacks, so we were both back down this morning!

    Late last night Dad called. Uncle Don did not survive his COVID infection. Dad didn't seem to want to talk. Either he was trying to call a bunch of people, or was feeling emotional. Either way, it is sad.

- Nov 12, 2020 5:54 AM (CST)

    Big travel yesterday. 214 miles. Took longer than expected. I definitely don't add enough time for stops, etc. when I estimate travel time. Plus I was feeling a bit sluggish/tired after the previous night's margarita+beer w/ Philip and Shelley at Mi Cocula. Disount Tire aired up tires to 80-front 85-rear - that's 5 over 'recommended' levels on the door, but I'm sure it's well within the tire maximums, and it's a good trick from my hypermiler days. Also fired up the bluetooth odbii device, watched gauges while driving. Need to move that over to the iPad. Definitely better than the dash gauges, but need to customize dashboard and maybe mount on top of the steering column? This will keep the phone free for podcasts, etc. Maybe even move the maps to the ipad, split-screen, but would have to have turn-by-turn through car speakers while podcasting through Airpods. Need to experiment!

    Called Dad last night, had a nice chat. Later got a text from him that Uncle Don had COVID and was 'critical' which I take it means he's in the ICU. Waiting for updates (update - no change - evidently refused ventilator (you can do that?)

    Re-arranged bikes in car - think it's in a more workable state now. Hung out in Barnes & Noble awhile. Checked out many books and magazines (current affairs, social science + archaeology) - WalMart on the way home. Tried to test bikes on a trail but one trailhead was closed and couldn't find anywhere near a trail to actually park!

    Tested various items for electricity usage. Replaced some older LED bulbs with newer ones - saving .5 watt per fixture!

    Downloaded several books from book store photos.

Both of us took a brief spin around the RV park, everything appears to be functional. Need to fine-tune the wheels and gear shift adjustments.

    Final dinner w/ Philip and Shelly - margaritas, beer and too many chips at Mi Cocula. About to pass out! It is almost 9pm...

    Just started my first notes here, but I've been up an hour already! 

    Did some mapping last night. Enjoyable, but outlining buildings from fuzzy imagery is difficult. May wait until something gets reviewed before proceeding. Reading up on overall views of HOT and volunteer submissions before committing more time.

    Day 6 using this 'productivity journal' concept. It really does feel like something I could be consistent with. Given the way I find myself using it, as both a regular journal *and* a productivity journal, it provides extra reasons for usage. On days I'm less task-oriented, I can be more introspective (like right now). When my introspection fades, I can get shit done and document it. So, win-win basically!
    Figured out how to open/close the toggle via keyboard (Cmd+Enter) - makes it easier to start a new entry? And yet, I somehow managed to type two paragraphs that are somehow a 'title' or 'header' of this toggle, not actually *inside* the toggle. I mean, right below this line I'm typing, it says "Empty toggle. Click or drop blocks inside.' - so I did something wrong somehow. Need to test this.
    So now all this text is *inside* the toggle, but the Cmd+Enter doesn't toggle it anymore *throws hands up in air*
    Side note - to change a block type, start typing '/turn' and you get a pop-up list of options!

    At some point I became convinced that I needed to use 'Shift+Enter' to keep from jumping outside of the current toggle block. Evidently not!

    PASSWORDS: I've been testing Enpass. Main pros are that it seems to catch any new or changed password better than Bitwarden, and in iOS I get the option to use TouchID so I don't have to retype the damned password a gillion times. Con? No support whatsoever even *planned* for ARM64 platform, so I can't use it on the Pi, because even the browser extension *requires* a desktop app. So what are they going to do on the Mac platform? In two days Apple will announce probably three new models that are on Apple Silicon chips. That's ARM! So just drop Mac support? This makes no sense whatsoever. So - apps/platforms to explore:

    [[Password Managers]]

    And after all that, I chose 1Password. Bryn doesn't need a family plan, happy w/ Apple Keychain. So just me, 30-day trial, then subscription of like $36/year. 

    Went walking in Philip and Shelly's neighborhood. Not too far, but good way to restart and get out of cooped-up RV.

    Time to get back into helping with OpenStreetMap projects for H.O.T. (Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team)

    Richard is back in CDMX - currently in Little Tokyo but looking around. That area is *nice*! He is paying $700/mo for it.

    FINALLY!!! About 9:20AM or so. Vice-President Elect Joe Biden. AP called PA and everyone else followed suit within 5 minutes. Then Fox added NV.

- Nov 6, 2020 8:26 AM (CST)

    Wow. I can't believe yesterday's notes were so short! I meant to go back and update them, even this morning, but really - that should be done here in today's notes.

    As an aside: JOE BIDEN NOW HAS AN ELECTORAL LEAD (273) AND SHOULD BE DECLARED PRESIDENT NOW!!!!!
    Except, only DecisionDeskHQ has called it for him. The others will soon follow, I'm sure. That will at least shift the conversation, and increasingly make Trump look like a whining, sore loser. Most politicians have already started distancing themselves from him. They've seen the writing on the wall.
    Been reading this morning. Am increasingly uncomfortable with The Young Turks' brash extremism. Centrism is surely the only solution, right? Maybe a Centrist party, get away from all the old labels. Work together, get shit done. Tea Party types don't want Universal Basic Income, Justice Democrats don't want anything to do with fossil fuels. But they can both elect representatives who can yell at each other all day, then get elected again, ad nauseum. All the while, nothing happens. And that means NO PROGRESS. And if there's no progress, why be a 'progressive.'???
    Nov 6, 2020 9:36 AM (CST) *Finally* got video working ok on the Pi. Took a few different things to achieve it. One, I had to give up on HEVC/x265 formats. So far I have been unable to get this working on the Pi. Two, downloaded Ubuntu Mate 20.04.1. Unlike Ubuntu 20.04.1 and 20.10 (with Gnome defaults) MATE works. Chromium is not installed, Firefox is default. I fixed video playback in Firefox and on the desktop using [this guide](https://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/rpi4-ubuntu-mate-hw-video-acceleration.html). So evidently it was always all about getting the *hardware* to do more of the heavy lifting. Changed config for dtoverlay, framebuffers, gpu memory, etc. Did not mess w/ memory splitting. And it worked! Fixed firefox by forcing hardware acceleration/compositing so that it shows openGL now, and video (like live election coverage) works there as well. Watched two series episodes using default 'Celluloid' player. Had to go back and download new copies of some things, sticking to x264 versions. Figured out how to restrict searches so that *only* that format shows up in results. Cool!
    Nov 6, 2020 1:17 PM (CST) A bit surprised at how much of this project is me using it as more of a regular journal, vs. a purely 'productivity' journal. I should be able to use several things here for my web site as well. I've been reading Baseless by Nicholson Baker. The section on Cuba is interesting, in part because everything we were doing leading up to the Bay of Pigs (and even after) was all around the time I was born. We never called it war (other than the 'Cold' War) but we were, in fact, at war with Cuba. The fact that Che made a peace offer, one that would have distanced them from Russia, was classified and unknown for *30 years*. Just more proof that classification of documents has always been for the purpose of hiding shady and/or illegal shit. Period.

    Nov 6, 2020 4:38 PM (CST) While waiting for election results (and while Bryn is on WalMart run) watching some 'The Boys'

- Nov 5, 2020 5:27 AM (CST)

    Woke up kinda early, but watch says I slept over 6 hours w/ good quality time, so - I'm up! (at 4:30am)
    Compiled a spreadsheet tracking vote differences over time for AZ/PA/GA just because. Looking good in Georgia, not good in AZ. Analysts aren't worried, so I'm not either. Yet. Pennsylvania is a slog and there are disagreements over exactly how many ballots are still left to count, which determines whether or not Biden has a chance to recover.

    Nov 5, 2020 6:09 AM (CST) I have to admit that I really enjoy hearing coyotes howl as they head out for the night and then again when they return. 

- Nov 4, 2020 6:54 AM (CST)

    So, evidently I typed 1400 words in yesterday's entries. That's not a bad day of writing. Too bad none of that went into anything important or more permanent, like an essay, or a blog post, or heck, a book even! Oh well, it was journaling and that's supposed to be good for you, right?
    Very fitful sleep last night. We were both up from 2-2:45 or so tossing and turning and trying to check on election results on our phones. The news was *slightly* better, but geeze. Now, at 6:30-7:00am, much better. Michigan is about to shift to a lead for Biden as the mail-in ballots are slowly counted. Biden's lead in Wisconsin is slowly growing, same reasons. 
    Nov 4, 2020 7:54 AM (CST) Last political note for now - w/ NV/AZ/WI and MI Biden wins, even without Pennsylvania. The pollsters still see PA in play. I haven't heard how many ballots are outstanding, would need to be a LOT
    Looking back at yesterday's journaling, it felt a lot like blogging, especially with my photos and embeds. But I've really soured on blogging, as in 'regular updates in date order' and am much more interested in writing longer 'evergreen' pieces that I update here and there as I learn more about topics. Theoretically that's a good use for a ZettelKästen, keeping the notes separate, tied together by bi-directional links, then eventually synthesize things into broader, more coherent thoughts. This might be the best use-case for a ZK for me, outside of future essays, etc.
    Related note - my site is mostly just Evergreen content now. I should probably figure out how to use that. I mean, if no one ever sees it, why have it online at all? Obviously online means 'easy to share' but this feels like something that needs to be resolved

    Nov 4, 2020 9:04 AM (CST) After more thinking, I believe I may have a couple of partial solutions for the task problem. One, of course, is this journal. But since ToDoist didn't really 'work' for me, I think I may revert to Kanban boards. Cards can be either projects or individual tasks. But if a project is a card, the subtasks can be just a to-do list w/ checkmarks inside the card. And you can do that on Notion. So now I have a task board right here, inside the productivity journal. At the top. We'll see how this works for a few days or weeks.
    Got approval to stay here another week. Unfortunately our Monday appointment to see Mom and Dad is now unlikely since there was another COVID case in the facility and everyone is back in their rooms for quarantine. It is the wise and *safe* thing to do, and we got to meet the director yesterday and she seems very serious and on the ball and we are thankful for that. But it must be hard on the residents. Will need to call them more often!
    Nov 4, 2020 9:33 AM (CST) OK, all tasks moved into Taskboard here above the journal area. Seems like a good easy access setup. We'll see.
    Nov 4, 2020 8:47 PM (CST) Went to Target - had some nice Schwinn Trailways hybrid bikes. Will probably pick up a couple of these. Need to then mount them so we can carry in CR-V, but need to get rid of damned wheel/spare first. Came home. Tried to watch some video on RPi4 - skipping and glitching. Unable to fix so far, need to work on this again in the morning. Too tired for now.
    Biden *almost* has 270. Waiting for either Pennsylvania, Georgia or Arizona to tip the scales and get called. Incredibly tense and worn out from the wait. Ugh.
    Looked at SimpleLogin and AnonAddy as potential solutions to spam - don't get a *ton* but enough...

- Nov 3, 2020 7:00 AM (CST)

    So, here I am testing Notion for possibly doing a roam-like free-flowing daily notes, mainly for use regarding 'productivity' - specifically, using this as a journal to track 'the things I have done or are doing' versus 'here is a huge list of things I need to do.' Supposedly, this is a better approach. I certainly hope so, because lately I've been doing a whole lot of staring at my list versus actually doing things on the list. It's also likely that my list is too vague. I have it divided into projects, which Todoist wants to keep very separately. If I 'view all' using a filter, it throws things up in a particular order which I don't think I can control. The result is ... overwhelm.
    So, re: Notion - since I'm trying to replicate some of Roam's layout, I have to use Shift+Enter in order to start a new paragraph, but keep it inside the existing 'Today' notes. Not sure I want to do that. Kinda defeats Notion's concepts of blocks.

    And - aha! I can add the 'Today' at-marker, then hit Enter, start a new block, but everything below the 'Today' thing *appears* to be under it. Tomorrow I'll do another at-command and theoretically these notes here will show up under yesterday's dates. I guess I need to experiment with these date features more to understand how they work.

    Various things I have tried so far today, for this productivity journal idea:

    [Jermolene/TiddlyDesktop](https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyDesktop)

    [joekroese/tiddlyroam](https://github.com/joekroese/tiddlyroam)

    I also looked at a few other things, like org-roam, which uses emacs' org-mode, but the on-boarding time investment is too high. I tried emacs and spacemacs etc. before and the unusual keyboard commands were just a really high barrier for someone who has been a touch-typist for decades on standard Windows and Mac keyboard command conventions (Ctrl or Cmd + everything else). A quick look at a [Gnu Emacs reference sheet](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf) shows that almost all commands require TWO sets of keyboard commands. To move the cursor back and forwards, you use Ctrl+b or Ctrl+f. To move a word back or forwards, you hit the Escape key (don't hold it) and then hit b or f. This is *archaic*! Here's what a keyboard looked like when emacs was created:

    ![https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Space-cadet.jpg/1920px-Space-cadet.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Space-cadet.jpg/1920px-Space-cadet.jpg)

    You can see the Hyper, Super, Meta and Control keys. These have been almost completely superceded by now. My MacBook has shortened the space bar to include Function, Control, Option (or Alt) and Command keys *inside* the left margin of where the Tab, Rub Out and Shift keys are in this picture. Emacs makes more sense when you see this old keyboard layout. It makes very little sense if you began typing class on, say, an IBM selectric, as I did in high school.

    Follow-up thought - just discovered I can start each day's entry with '@Now' and this will insert both today's date *and time* ! Perfect!

    A couple of things I need to do before breakfast

    - Set an alarm for 1pm so we don't forget to meet Mom and Dad (why did we decide to meet on Election Day? Maybe that's better since Biden is going to kick Trump's ass)
    - And...I completely forgot the second thing. Fuck! This is so fucking typical...

    need to determine how to make entries like today's *collapsible* - I guess using the 'toggle' feature...

    Finished adding TV Series info to Airtable

    [https://airtable.com/embed/shr2AdyodPggcotxt?backgroundColor=green&layout=card&viewControls=on](https://airtable.com/embed/shr2AdyodPggcotxt?backgroundColor=green&layout=card&viewControls=on)

    NOTE: embedded using iframe code - works!

    Finally put all this inside a toggle, using the 'Today' code for the title of the toggle - when collapsed, all toggles will represent one day - will look nicer, more compact, and can toggle any day open or shut as needed. I think I like that layout!

    Need to figure out what to do with the never-ending master project/task list - not sure exactly where that fits within a 'productivity journal' framework

    Nov 3, 2020 11:18 AM (CST) So I can add the date/time anywhere and/or anytime I want. Probably should do that when there's been a big break in time.

    very 'Roam'-like 😂

    OK, reading up more on my new journaling technique. I'm already 'doing it wrong' ! 😕 Apparently, the official title, which I had to look up by going into yesterday's browser history, is "[Interstitial Journaling](https://medium.com/better-humans/replace-your-to-do-list-with-interstitial-journaling-to-increase-productivity-4e43109d15ef)" as coined by the person everyone says created it, Tony Stubblebine, a.k.a., Coach Tony. The part I've been missing is this order of things:

    - What did you just do?
    - Thoughts/worries about what you just did
    - Your next thing to do, including all steps

    I don't see any of that yet, on this super-long page of notes. I should probably start!

    Speaking of projects, yesterday we finally started cleaning the outside of the RV. So far we washed (soapy water w/ sponge) then washed/waxed with the Meguiar's blue liquid spray. Front cab part of the van looks pretty nice, back wall looks nice. Front of the cabover hasn't seen the blue spray yet, but arms were tired and it was late. Today's kinda busy, so maybe tomorrow.

    Speaking of tomorrow, we kinda need to decide if we're staying for another week. If so, I need to email the park about another week and maybe some sort of prorated monthly rate? I also need to email Spike about staying at her Tiny T ranch. Oddly, while it would be nice to talk to her and do some rock climbing in the area, eat at our fave vegan places, our friend Peggy has gone rather silent. I don't know if this is something we said or did, or if she is just staying offline for her  mental health.

    Also need to figure out how to handle visiting Anna, if that will even work. She has *also* been quite quiet the last several months.

    Nov 3, 2020 11:51 AM (CST) So I emailed Spike about staying at the Tiny T.

    Nov 3, 2020 12:06 PM (CST) Starting to look at Schwab Designated Beneficiary plan - do we already have the 'high yield investor checking' account? (evidently it's the only type of checking they have, so ... yes! And Spike says yes! No charge! Emailed Crosswinds RV about staying *here* another week, then we would leave the 11th, stay w/ Spike until the 16th, when we would drive to Livingston. If we can stay here...

    Nov 3, 2020 1:00 PM (CST) Now heading for Mom and Dad's

    Nov 3, 2020 5:17 PM (CST) Had a nice visit - throat got a bit dry from yelling to be heard through the mask and with Mom's bad ear. Made an appointment to visit again on Monday, this time before lunch to stay out of the hot sun! Stopped at Sam's and WalMart on the way home. Realized that I'm *really* pissed every time I see a stupid pickup w/ huge Trump flags. Remembering how big of a lead Biden has in all the polls helped mostly. Settling in for dinner, an episode of Fargo, and keeping one eye on election results all night, trying to hide it from Bryn until a couple of networks call it. Hopefully the polls were all off a bit *in Biden's favor* so the Trump cult is stunned into silence as they realize their true minority status.

    Nov 3, 2020 8:21 PM (CST) Taking a break from endless results watching. A few things are edging in Trump's favor, like Florida, and it brings up some seriously negative deja vu. Just saw a note on 538 that even high-quality surveys get response rates of 2-3 percent. Beginning to think that polls might have somehow managed to lean Dem. again. How/why do they do that, and why do we keep falling for it? I guess maybe Obama.
