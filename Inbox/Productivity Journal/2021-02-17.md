07:54 Finally! Figured out how to insert the current time (need to add a keyboard shortcut) 
So - biggest thing from yesterday - exported Notion, ran it through a converter script, imported the whole thing here into Obsidian. UGH. What a freakin' mess. Today begins the cleanup/curation.
First major step, install plugins. Had the Natural Date plugin (which allows for the insertion of Dates/Times) installed. Also installed the 'slide' plugin which emulates Andy Matuschak's awesome web page. But then I never flipped the toggle on them to actually turn them on! But now I have. They work better when turned on. LOL
And now I'm journaling again. I have all my old journal entries, and *supposedly* when today is done, this entry will be saved with the others. Not entirely sure if it will be inside the page with the rest or a separate file...
Slider plugin not working as expected, not sure why
Stayed an extra day here in Davenport - tomorrow, two nights at a park south of here, then four nights in Homestead near Everglades. After that, north!
