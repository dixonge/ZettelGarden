# Implement Spam tactics

Status: Completed

- [ ]  ~~Change login emails over to aliases~~
    - [ ]  ~~SimpleLogin~~
    - [ ]  ~~AnonAddy~~
- [ ]  ~~Switch main email to ProtonMail?~~

In the end, achieved this with FastMail aliases. The FastMail client also has spam reporting options, but using unique email addresses and passwords for all accounts seems best. If an email address is sold, just delete it so they go to /null and then either change it or just delete that account. Now back to using glenn@thedixons.net as main email. Will probably drop the donblanco@posteo.net eventually.
