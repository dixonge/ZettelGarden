This is our first official **[BWWOW](http://www.eatsavetravel.com/tag/body-weight-workout-of-the-week)** and we’re hoping that you’ll follow along with our weekly Kettlebell and Body Weight Workouts which will go live each and every Monday morning at 7AM EST.

### 

Okay guys, so here’s the deal. There are 6 different exercises involved in this workout. All of the exercises except for one (Bent over Rows) require using your own body weight! Pace yourself through this one.

***Always consult a doctor before performing any fitness exercise!***

### 

The 1st round you will do 10 Reps of each exercise (1 through 6). After you’re finished with your 10′s, continue to 9 reps, 8 reps, 7 reps, and so on until you finish your last round of 1 rep. By the end of the workout you should have completed 55 reps of each exercise which ends up being a grand total of 330 reps in all.

See if you can complete the entire workout without taking a break. Yes, it’s going to be tough, and **YES**, you **CAN** do it.

**Tip:** Do yourself a favor and start out on the lighter side and once you get through a few exercises you can move up to heavier bells.

### 

However long it takes you! **Challenge yourself…**
