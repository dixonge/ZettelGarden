Catching Up

First thing I had to do when I started to get back 'in' to crypto was to catch up on the ton of things that happened since 2014. Observations, in no particular order:

- Bitcoin is still king, all other coin in generally a pretender
- Ethereum had a coin (ether) as well as a separate distributed ledger system that seems to make it easier/better/faster - especially for corporations and banking, part of an overall 'DeFi' movement (DEcentralized FInance) - the blockchain is too delayed for this most of the time
- Some crypto coins were now being pegged to existing currencies - StableCoins - useful for applications where cryptocoin volatility is way too high
- Lots more exchanges and wallet solutions
- Lots more options for increasing value on top of market price - interest, loans, staking, etc.
- Stock market investing just starting to appear - derivatives and synthetics
- A few banks are starting to get state and/or federal approval - FDIC insurance on crypto!

More details below:

- DLT - Distributed Ledger Technology

    The blockchain, infamous for being the backbone of Bitcoin, is one form of DLT. To me, a good analogy is the DNS system of the internet. You buy a domain name from a registrar. Within a very short time, that information is copied out to all DNS servers in the world, so no matter who is looking for your domain name, they will get a result from their nearest DNS server. In the blockchain each node has a full copy of all bitcoin transactions. Any server or person looking to verify a transaction can get a response from any node. 

WIP - current outline:

- Blockchain and DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology)
- Ethereum and DeFi
- Stablecoins
- Exchanges and Wallets
- Value gain + Interest?
- Tokens and Rewards - Points vs Cash
- Synthetics/Derivatives
- Full Banking - possible?
- Stock investing - possible?
