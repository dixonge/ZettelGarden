# Current holdings

As of now (early Feb. 2021) I am holding a mix of ETH (Ether/Ethereum) and BTC (Bitcoin)

I currently have them parked at two different exchanges. Some is at the Celsius network, mainly to take advantage of a nice referral bonus and deposit bonus. The rest is with BlockFi. At this point I plan on moving the Celsius coins over to BlockFi just because they pay interest in Bitcoin instead of forcing you to use their own token, which they don't actually have.
