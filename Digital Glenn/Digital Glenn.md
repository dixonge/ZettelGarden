### Glenn's Digital Garden

This is not a blog!

I've been blogging since 1998, when I registered this domain name and [[hand-crafted my own site]]. 

This site is different. I am combining several different recent trends here:

- [Personal Knowledge Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management) system
    - [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/)
    - [Commonplace Book](https://indieweb.org/commonplace_book)
- [Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)
- [Learning in Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/)
    - [Evergreen](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C)

The main difference you'll see is that many of my articles/essays are works-in-progress (WIP), evolving ideas, revised and updated as needed. Therefore, there will generally be no organization by publication date, although dates are sometimes provided, especially as content is updated. Much of the current content is older, but new thoughts and notes will be added regularly.
