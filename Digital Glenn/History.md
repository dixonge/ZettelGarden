Back in 2014 I ran across references to DOGEcoin - it was fun, I threw in around $100 and learned about the basics and wallets and exchanges. Eventually I transferred back and forth between various crypto coins and stored it in a wallet on my hard drive. After a few computer moves I ended up unable to log back in. I *thought* I had the right password, but things just never worked right. As best I can tell, the last coin I was using was already down so low that my wallet was worth about $5, so no big loss. I obviously didn't see enough value to reinvest, or switch to BTC. The idea faded, I moved on through various other investments and ended up with the bulk of my money in plain old, boring S&P 500 index funds.
