- Systems vs. Apps

    (this is something I posted on [talk.macpowerusers.com](https://talk.macpowerusers.com/t/systems-vs-apps/14014) )

    There are three different current threads all closely related:

    1 - [Field Guide for Picking Apps and Sticking With Them](https://talk.macpowerusers.com/t/field-guide-for-picking-apps-and-sticking-with-them/13982/9)
    2 - [Too Many Apps Reduce Productivity](https://talk.macpowerusers.com/t/too-many-apps-reduce-productivity/13976/30)
    3 - [Time to Rip Off the Evernote Bandaid](https://talk.macpowerusers.com/t/time-to-rip-off-the-evernote-bandaid-can-you-help-me-to-chose-my-new-evernote/13483/21)

    Instead of pasting the same response in each one and having the discussion spread out, I thought I would consolidate them here. The reason I think they can be joined is that I think the answer for each is the same: you don't need new apps, or less apps, or different apps (necessarily) - you need a better system.

    Yes, I know, we tend to switch systems as frequently as we do apps, but I've found what feels like a great 'master' system. Specifically, it is Tiago Forte's 'Building a Second Brain' system. More info:

    Excellent sketchnote/visual guide/overview: [https://illustrated.dev/sketches/secondbrain1](https://illustrated.dev/sketches/secondbrain1)

    I found the PARA approach to organizing very instructive and helpful. And it is designed to work in *any* app, as detailed here:

    [https://praxis.fortelabs.co/the-p-a-r-a-method-a-universal-system-for-organizing-digital-information-75a9da8bfb37/](https://praxis.fortelabs.co/the-p-a-r-a-method-a-universal-system-for-organizing-digital-information-75a9da8bfb37/)

    Tiago uses evernote, the last I heard, but I have found an excellent implementation/template for the system using [[]] - my current app of choice:

    [https://praxis.fortelabs.co/how-to-build-a-second-brain-in-notion/](https://praxis.fortelabs.co/how-to-build-a-second-brain-in-notion/)

    So - hope that helps. I also hope that making a separate thread doesn't upset any one - just trying to simplify, that's all :)
