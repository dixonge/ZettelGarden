DIY: Inverter Installation Made (Relatively) Easy

Solar power has become increasingly popular, especially with those who frequently boondock or choose to totally live off the grid. It's clean, sustainable, and after a fairly large initial investment, it's basically free. In order to convert your RV to solar power, you may need to install an inverter. Your existing electrical control box converts the campground's 120-volts of AC shore power to the 12-volts DC power required for your lights, controls, fans, and electrical outlets. It also helps keep your batteries charged.

To avoid ruining your batteries—an expensive mistake—you need to make a few modifications to your converter box before installing an AC converter box. You should also consider installing an [aftermarket charge controller](https://www.wholesalesolar.com/charge-controllers) too and lengthen their life and improve their reliability. Follow these steps.

**1. Make Sure to Turn Off All Power**

First, it is necessary to make sure there is absolutely no power to the RV—none. If you have one running, shut down your generator, unplug from the shore power, and disconnect all of the batteries. Leaving any power connected to the RV results in electricity running through the lines, meaning that you increase the risk of fire, electric shock, and even death while you work.

Once you've disconnected everything, double check that there's no power. Even disconnect the RV's starter battery. It's better to be safe than sorry.

**2. Disconnect and Remove the Converter Box**

Next, remove the four screws holding on the cover plate at the bottom of the control box. Then, remove the four screws holding in place the slide out box of the AC to DC converter circuitry. Typically, this consists of five wires: two AC wires, white and black and the three larger DC wires, red, white, and blue.

Partially, slide out the box to find the five wires and cut them. Then slide them out through the top of the box. This allows you to easily remove the converter box. You no longer need the box, so look into local laws regulating how to properly dispose of it.

**3. Secure the Wires**

To reconnect the DC circuitry in your RV, connect the red and blue wires together in order. Secure them by either soldering them or using [wire nuts](https://www.lennoxpros.com/parts-and-supplies/installation-supplies/electrical-hardware/wire-nut-connectors/c/p125?gclid=CjwKCAiAweXTBRAhEiwAmb3Xu-ndPm6li7TOz2RqQW7CCCZLdKNM5yYxCvqt-a-pJAMeqSV5b_hE3RoC4IEQAvD_BwE) and tape. Tape off the ends of the AC wire, as well as the white wire. Get them all out of the way by tucking back inside the control box.

**4. Find Your Primary Wires**

Find the AC power line. This is a thick, black wire that is located either on the top of the control box or in the back. Trace that wire to the junction box; open the box and find the three wires that enter it. They are white, black, and green or bare copper. The white is the AC neutral wire; black is the AC hot wire, and the green or copper wire is the ground wire. These are normally connected to the AC power line with wire nuts.

**5. Run Your Wire to Your Intended Inverter Destination**

Some inverters have three screw-in terminals to connect it to the AC lines; others have a standard plug. So, check your particular inverter manual for details.

You'll want to use as large a gauge wire as you can like a [2 or 4 gauge](https://www.lowes.com/search?searchTerm=4+gauge+wire), and keep the wires short. So, find a spot as close to the batteries as possible to place your inverter. Then run an AC wire along the RV walls (or inside if possible) or under the floor from the control box to the inverter, making sure to fasten the wire securely and keep it away from any moving parts.

**6. Connect Your Inverter**

Wire one end into the junction box. Make sure to keep matching colors together, black to black, and so on, and then secure them in place with the original wire nuts. Using electrical tape on the wires and nuts provides additional security. Then, connect the other end to your new inverter.

**7. Double Check and Connect**

Before connecting your battery bank, double check the power control box wiring to make sure all of the connections are secure and there aren't any exposed wires. When you're confident, connect the inverter to your battery bank and test it out. Just plug something in, turn it on, and see if it works. If it does, you have power! Close any junction boxes, cleanup, and you're done.

**In Conclusion**

For many, electrical work feels really intimidating. That makes sense; it can be dangerous and even deadly. With due diligence, proper precautions, and care when working, installing an inverter is an easy task to accomplish. I hope this helps you feel confident. If you don't, you should consider getting a professional or at least an experienced helper. Good luck and enjoy your solar power!
