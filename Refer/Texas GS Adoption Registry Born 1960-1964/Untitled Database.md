There is also a number next to the time of birth, ""file number"" 24782. I don't know what this number is, but it might be of importance. Although my hair is now brown, as a child it was blonde and I have blue eyes and fair skin. What little information Depelchin furnished said my mother had brown hair and blue eyes, was 5'2"" tall and weighed apr. 110 lbs. My maternal grandmother had red hair and fair skin. My birth father had dark hair and eyes. I was adopted through DePelchin Faith Home in Houston, Texas. I was told that my birth mother was 14 years old and that my birth father was younger. They met in music class, but my birth mother would / could not furnish additional information about my birth father. I have been told that I was named ""Gabriella"" by my birth mother, although this is not in any written documentation. I was adopted into a wonderful family and have had a wonderful life, which includes a child of my own. As I enter my forties, I am interested in obtaining some type of medical history for my own personal knowledge, as well as for my child. My child's father was also adopted and has no medical history, so my child also has no history. In this day and time of medical advances, with so much based on genetics, I would like some information so that when the doctor asks if I ""have a history of....."" I can give an accurate answer. Since I was given up by a very young birth mother, I can understand that she may have ""moved on"" with her life and others may not know about me. At the same time, as a mother I cannot fathom having a child and not wondering if they are happy and healthy. I am both happy and healthy and simply want to tell my birth mother ""thank you"" for having enough love in her heart to do what was best for me and my future. At the same time, I would be happy to meet either of my birth parents, or others from my birth family if so desired. She is listed in birth books under ammended name.

I found and reunited with my birth families and just recently learned I have a birth brother or half-birth brother who was also given up for adoption. He was born the summer (maybe fall) of 1962. Maybe in the DFW, TX, area. I am searching for him. Our birth mother was 20 years old when she had me. She became pregnant again shortly after my birth, and gave birth to my birth brother (or half-birth brother) when she was 21 years old. She is originally from Huntsville, TX, and was attending SHSU when I was conceived. She has three sisters and one brother. Her father worked at SHSU. She is very tall and long-limbed and had brown eyes and dark brown hair (now silver). I am tall and had brown eyes and auburn hair (now silver). We were both quite skinny until we hit our fifties, and now we're both apple-shaped. I've tested at AncestryDNA, 23andMe, and FTDNA and have uploaded to GEDmatch. (Update) Birth mother was 5'10"" tall, I am 5'9"" tall, with brown eyes and I had dark auburn hair (it's silver now).Date Received: 3-10-2017Date Posted: 3-10-2017Last Updated: 3-12-2017"

He Was Adopted At 3 Months Of AgeAll Other Information: Timothy has 3 older sisters and 1 older brother. He may have been adopted with one sister, Robin Scott (Not sure if this is her last or middle name). She was about 18 - 24 months old and would have been born in probably 4-?-1961 to 9-?-1961. No record of the birth of these two can be found, so the records were evidently changed at the time of adoption. The other two older sisters (I am one) were adopted into one family together. The older brother remained with the bio mother and was not removed from the home (he was 5 years old and staying with relatives). All three girls along with Timothy Wayne were given away in ?-?-1963 by the bio mother . Timothy Wayne was taken to Louisiana by a woman who used to baby sit for the bio mother. When authorities were notified by suspicious friends of the babysitter when she showed up with a baby, she was arrested and so was the mother, after she revealed the mother! had given him to her. This was about 2-?-1963 or 3-?-1963 or 4-?-1963. A mention of these non-identifying details were found in an article in the Houston Chronicle Newspaper. The article indicated Timothy was returned to Houston where he and his three sisters were placed at Burnett Bayland county Orphanage for Girls and Burnett Bayland county Orphanage for Boys. These facilities were next door to one another on Chimney Rock Rd in Houston, Texas. They were large two story mansions back then, but have since been revamped as modern one story multi-building facilities. As one of the older sisters, I have personal knowledge of these facts and remember being at the orphanage as a child and revisiting as an adult. When placed there in ?-?-1963, we were not allowed contact with either Timothy or Robin. We were told by a staff member they were adopted within a month and may have gone to the same family. However, the news article indicated a wealthy Childless couple expressed interest in Robin. The babysitter was quoted as saying she wanted to adopt Timothy, however I do not even know her name and it is unknown if she was allowed to do so. I have had contact with the bio mother who is unable or unwilling to give me any information. From my memory (I was 7 years old, my older sister was 8), Robin was olive complected, had brown eyes, and medium brown curls. Her father was most likely Hispanic, but could have been a man named Joe or possibly J.V. Maness. The bio mother was married and had a son with J.V. Maness, but I am not certain he is the same person as the dark haired man named Joe. Timothy was blonde, blue-eyed and very pale. It is certain he had a Caucasian father. I remember him being called Timothy Wayne Bonneville and I remember an older man by the name of Harry Bonneville who stayed with us.&nbs! p; I remember Robin being called only as Robin Scott, so it is quite possible this is her last name. I have also had contact with the bio brother (blonde, blue-eyed) who was not removed from the home. As a child, I had brown eyes, blonde hair. My older sister had blue eyes, brown hair. The bio mother is blue-eyed with auburn hair. She was born in ?-?-1925 and is still living. Date Received: 10-5-2006Date Posted: 10-6-2006Last Updated: 10-6-2006Moved From Page #107 10-8-2007"

Looking for birth family. It has taken me many years to get to the place to reach out and try to find my birth mother and family........fear of being rejected or of finding out I waited too long. Please know that adoption is the most loving act a birth mother can do for their child when they are not ready or capable at the time to raise a child. I have never met an adopted person who did not have a loving home. My own adoptive parents who have now passed were the most incredible loving parents ever. They loved children so much that even after the heartbreak of miscarriages, a still born birth and losing a child in just a few days of life they continued to try to have children and finally were able to adopt. So, I just want you to know that if you are looking at this and in search of a missing piece of your heart know your child loves you even without ever meeting you. May the Lord bless you in your search, as I pray I am blessed in my own. (Update) I am 5'5"" tall, I have brown eyes and brown hair.

She was sent to the Edna Gladney Home in either Irving or Fort Worth, Texas while Pregnant. She gave birth to a 7 lb. 6 ounce baby boy on 6-6-1963. I was the only family member to see the infant. The baby was taken away from her before she had a chance to see him. My sister Elizabeth was brain damaged at birth and while not retarded had motor disabilities that made it difficult for her to maintain her balance and speech. She was injured during a forcep delivery and never got married. I would like to find this child who by now would be 48 years old. When I saw him he was a beautiful little boy with brown curly hair. He may likely have blue eyes. There would be no reason to believe that he had genetic health problems. We were told at the time that he had been adopted by a couple who was living in Irving, Texas but that may just be a rumor. I would like to meet him to tell him about his birth mother and other cousins if he wants. My sister Elizabeth was one of 7 children, the third. She died in 1997, two days before the death of our mother with whom she lived her entire life. Eliabeth was a sweet and loving person who never had a chance to see her baby boy. She was never allowed to speak of him in her lifetime. But, I did get to see this little baby in his crib in the hallway at Baylor Hospital on Gaston Avenue in Dallas, Texas. I would like to meet him before I die. He still has one uncle and 5 living aunts at this time and numerous cousins.Date Received: 9-12-2011Date Posted: 9-27-2011Last Updated: 11-29-2011 & 9-27-2011"
