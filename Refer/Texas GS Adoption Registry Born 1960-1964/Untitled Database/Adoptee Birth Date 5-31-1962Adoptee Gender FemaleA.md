The Attorney was Mike E. Powell I have registered on multiple sites since ?-?-1996 and can't even remember them all. I am listed in the "indexes" under my adopted name. I have NO non-id and no one to ask for it. I have spoken to Patricia Molina multiple times but all she can tell me is the name she has on my BC looks to be Eastern European. She also stated it was probably an alias. I've had many search angels but we all come to the same road block. I have not filed to have my records opened yet.Date Received: 10-20-2008Date Posted: 10-20-2008Last Updated: 10-20-2008
