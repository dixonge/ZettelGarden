My mom was told that her biological mother was French and that her biological father was in the military. She told me that her birth certificate says that she was born in Bexar County, Texas but her birth certificate was mailed from a different city and county. Palestine - Anderson County. So we are unsure if she was really born in San Antonio, Texas! My mom is white, has freckles, is about 5'3” tall, could have been 5'5” tall (as I am 5'5” tall), has hazel eyes, and light brown hair.Date Received: 3-27-2019Date Posted: 3-28-2019Last Updated: 3-29-2019
