Now we are looking for our older half-birth sister. Our birth mother was at an unwed girls home in Houston near Scott street. She couldn't give dates or the name of the home or hospital. She was very young and her mother made all the decisions. Her mother forced her there and kept it all very hush hush, never to speak of again. So she was traumatized without any family support during or after and blocked a lot out. She did say she held her first birth daughter and it was very emotional. I got my non-certified birth certificate showing Rita as my birth mother. I was able to meet her before she passed away in 2014. (Update) Birth mother was 16-18 years old at time of birth. She had blue eyes & brown hair. Date Received: 3-21-2016Date Posted: 3-23-2016Last Updated: 3-23-2016
