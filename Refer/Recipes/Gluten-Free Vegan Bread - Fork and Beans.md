# Gluten-Free Vegan Bread

*January 1, 2014 by [Cara](http://www.forkandbeans.com/author/admin/) |[390 Comments](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2014/01/01/gluten-free-vegan-bread/#comments)* 

Out of all of the baked goods I can think of, gluten-free vegan bread has been the most exhaustive on my list. In the past week I have made (and failed at) probably somewhere near 6 loaves*. Just in this past week*. That doesn’t include the week before, which if added together I probably made a total of 13. I have been on a witch hunt trying to present to you, my friends, a truly worthy gluten-free vegan bread to make at home that 1). Isn’t as heavy as a 24lb rock; 2). Is soft and moist but not gummy in the middle; 3). Actually rises like a normal loaf–not a goofy 2″ sized slice; and 4). Tastes good.

It’s been a mission more difficult than anticipated but one that has been accomplished. Come join me as I ring in the New Year with a new recipe for gluten-free vegan bread!

![[Gluten-Free%20Vegan%20Bread%20-%20Fork%20and%20Beans%20fb9ca3c51fd3479cbac6d28d1efe4034 03105e326fe960986433536369fecea1.jpg]]

First of all, can we talk about how sexy the rise is on this bread? Yes, let us!

**insert wolf whistle here**

Sexy, sexy. Maybe it’s just me but when I see a rise like this, I get a little sweaty.

Focus Cara. Let’s talk about this bread recipe and what went wrong with the previous ones, shall we? I kept trying repetitively to recreate a texture familiar in a regular loaf but found that simply combining yeast and gluten-free flour without eggs only created a very dense bread. If I want that, I might as well buy the store-bought versions. *You know what I’m talking about.* I’m not interested in a slice of bread that fits into the palm of my hand and weighs the same as my head. So I tried a mix of chia seeds, flax meal, and ground psyllium husk for each trial but I wasn’t happy with the results I was looking for (I might actually go back to chia and psyllium for a more compact sandwich loaf later). But right now I am looking for a soft bread that is reminiscent of the loaf I used to make in the bread machine. I would slice it in the morning, toast it, and spread some butter and apricot jam all over it and enjoy it with a cup of tea for breakfast. Slap yo’ mama, I found its gluten-free vegan version.

![[Gluten-Free%20Vegan%20Bread%20-%20Fork%20and%20Beans%20fb9ca3c51fd3479cbac6d28d1efe4034 436248e5a8825ce5827a821e6a40164f.jpg]]

So how could I recreate that texture if not with the help of eggs? That got my brain thinking about other recipes I have and it hit me–Why am I not using my apple cider vinegar and baking soda trick that I love? 1). It will help with the rise in the bread for sure (see the first picture to remind yourself how well it actually worked), and 2). It will aid with a soft, light texture I’m looking for (as seen in the rest of these pictures). I made this recipe twice now, switching up the amount of vinegar and baking soda and I didn’t notice that big of a difference. I loved the results from both of them…and I’m really hoping you will too.

If you find your bread is too soft for your liking (might I add in here again that this *is* soft bread–just what I was trying to attain) go ahead and toast it up for a firmer slice.

This is perfect gluten and egg free bread for toasting and slathering [nondairy butter](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2015/07/11/vegan-butter-substitute/) and jam all over it.

***Author: Fork & Beans***

***Serves: 10 slices***

**Ingredients**

**Wet Ingredients:**

- normal2¼ tsp. dry active yeast
- normal1 c. warm [nondairy milk](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2015/01/24/homemade-hemp-seed-milk/)
- normal2 tsp. granulated sugar
- normal1 c. warm water
- normal5 Tbsp. ground white chia seeds
- normal3 Tbsp. vegetable oil
- normal2 tsp. apple cider vinegar (or lemon juice)

**!Dry Ingredients**

- normal1 c. oat flour (or [see this post](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2013/12/30/guide-gluten-free-flours/) for a good substitute)*
- normal1 c. millet flour (or [see this post](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2013/12/30/guide-gluten-free-flours/) for a good substitute)*
- normal½ c. arrowroot powder
- normal½ c. tapioca starch
- normal¼ c. buckwheat flour
- normal1 tsp. baking powder
- normal½ tsp. baking soda
- normal½ tsp. salt

**Instructions**

1. In a medium bowl combine the warmed nondairy milk with the yeast and sugar. Allow to proof until frothy (approx.10 minutes).
2. Add the water, oil, vinegar, and chia seeds into the yeast mix and whisk until well-combined. Allow to sit for another 2 minutes so the chia seeds expand.
3. In a large bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and stir with a wooden spoon until just combined. Spoon the batter into a 8x4 (20x10 cm) loaf pan. Using the back of a spoon smooth out the top and gently press down to ensure there are no gaps in the batter. Allow to rise until the loaf rise just to the top of the pan (approx. 30 to 45 minutes) in a warm, non-drafty area of your kitchen. If it doubles before the allotted time, that's okay. Just proceed to baking it, no need to wait the total time.
4. Preheat oven to 350*F (190*C).
5. Place the loaf in the oven on the middle rack and bake for 60 minutes. Allow to cool in the pan briefly until you can remove it and transfer to a wire rack until it has completely cooled

**Notes**

*Do note that any changes made to the ingredients may alter the outcome of the bread.

Since I started writing my [cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/Decadent-Gluten-Free-Vegan-Baking-Dairy-Free/dp/1624140718/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1388521879&sr=8-1&keywords=cara+reed), I began to play around with different blends. And by play around, I mean I ran out of my usual flours and since where I live in Los Angeles has a terrible selection of gluten-free flours, I was in a great bind and needed to create a blend stat. I happened to have both whole oats and millet in my cupboard and so I ground them in my blender and found out how awesome this blend truly is! If you cannot digest oats, you can replace it with a Medium-Based Flour found in this [post](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2013/12/30/guide-gluten-free-flours/). Might I suggest that brown rice flour would also do well as a substitute.

Things to keep in mind when making this bread:

- The dough for gluten-free vegan bread is actually more like a thick batter. Do not necessarily expect it to look as you remember it to be from its gluten-filled counterpart. When you pour the batter into the loaf pan, you are almost spooning it in.
- Make sure your oven is at the correct temperature. Too hot and the crust will be crispy with a gummy inside OR will even make your bread collaspe.
- Use a heavy loaf pan to ensure your bread is evenly baked.
- If you think your bread has cooled enough to slice into, wait another hour. If you are anything like me, I get impatient but then pay for it with an uncooked middle.

I have been using your recipe but I never really got the perfect texture as it is in your picture. What do I have to change to the recipe if I use just GF blend?[Reply](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2014/01/01/gluten-free-vegan-bread/?replytocom=286313#respond)			Cat *says:*	[February 3, 2017 at 5:12 pm](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2014/01/01/gluten-free-vegan-bread/#comment-284873)	I was going crazy for a tuna melt four months into my doctor deleting gluten from my diet. I’ve now been able to enjoy those as well as toast with pumpkin butter. Marvelous!My fifth loaf of this bread is in the oven (one per week – not a baking marathon). They’ve all tasted good but the first two were not pretty, fallen, cracked and a little too dense. I still haven’t gotten the beautiful risen loaf in your photo but by number three I’d achieved a rise that stayed even with the top of the pan and a lovely crust and good texture all the way through. I’d never made bread and it did take a couple minor changes to get this right. (1) dairy milk (just because that is what I have in the refrigerator); (2) a piece of parchment on the bottom of the pan after loaf #2 stuck worked well; (3) It is winter and baking when it is 15 degrees outside means the furnace has sucked all the moisture out of the air in my house. I put a pie plate of hot water on the bottom shelf under my bread while it baked and that took care of cracking. (4) Two loaves fell. So I borrowed from another internet recipe and took 1/4 can of the brine from a can of garbanzo beans and added 1/2 teaspoon Cream of Tarter and whipped it up (like whip cream). I deleted 1/4 cup of milk from the liquid to compensate. After all the ingredients were just mixed, I folded the garbanzo brine foam in and put the dough in the pan and it seems to have solved fallen loaves. I froze the remaining garbanzo brine and it whipped up nicely for the next loaf.To any other bakers not getting exactly what you want, keep playing with this recipe. It is well worth it.

I made this today for the first time and used both the brine and the parchment paper and got a great loaf of bread – I’m so happy, since I’ve been searchigng for an egg-free gluten-free bread recipe and have finally been gifted with one that really works! And it’s good, too! Thank you so much Cara, and thank you Cat for posting your tips. Oh, and I cooked it on 300 degrees for an hour in my convection toaster oven, then I let it sit in the pan for about a half hour before taking it out to cool on a rack. It turned out perfectly. Oh, and the real critic in our household – my son – gave the bread a thumbs up. Yay!!!

love your blog. I am about to attempt this for the first time, and on reading comments, it looks like lots of temperature problems. I saw a previous reader asked if you had fan force or convection oven as I have a fan force and trying to get that answer… so for those with a fan force oven 190 degrees is equal to 210degrees if it’s not based on a fan force oven which might be apart of the problem? Is your oven fan force? If it’s not then that means I would need to cook my loaf at 170 degrees. Would like to get it right up front rather than waste my ingredients!! Can you reply? thanks a million, Nic[Reply](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2014/01/01/gluten-free-vegan-bread/?replytocom=284533#respond)			Brendan *says:*	[January 23, 2017 at 2:32 am](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2014/01/01/gluten-free-vegan-bread/#comment-282960)	Thank you so much for this recipe! I’ve been experimenting and hunting for gluten-free bready recipes that are also egg-free for ages without much success until this.My first attempt turned out brilliant and was most importantly devoured by my daughter  I deviated slightly from the recipe:
– I used full-cream cows milk (DD is only allergic to wheat and eggs)
– I used Woolworths brand gluten-free plain flour which I think is mostly white rice but some tapioca as well. I used this in place of your millet, oats, and tapioca
– I used whole buckwheat groats as this is what i had in the pantry. Milled in the thermomix like the chia seedsI was also a bit hasty and sliced one end off. It was quite tacky but not gooey, and it definitely improved as it cooled down. I’m going to freeze the loaf sliced. This is what I do for regular sourdough. If it’s for school lunches I make sure it’s in a sealed container – this keeps it from drying out. If it’s for immediate eating I warm it in a sandwich press that’s reached temp and turned off.

I do have one question – is it 5 Tbl Chia seeds and then grin them up or is it 5 Tbl of them when they are ground? I measured them first and then ground them and it seemed to work fine. I just started to question myself.

I have tried it with different flour blends, different baking temperatures, and even an overnight rise. Sometimes, the bread has risen in the oven, other times, it has fell.  For me, baking the bread at 350 for a whole hour results in a slightly burnt crust with a very gooey center, so, I tend to bake it at 300 now-a-days, although it doesn’t result in a pretty, risen end result. I think that next time I make it, I will bake it at 350 for 20 minutes or so and then turn down the temperature to 275 for 40-55 minutes to cook the center through.  None the less, I love this bread and am super thankful for you finding this perfect recipe for us. I turn it into texas toast and serve it with bbq jackfruit, which has been so much of a friend favorite that I shared it on my blog, kimberlyandryan.tumblr.com.  Thank you for going through so many trials and errors so that we don’t have to do as many!!

Do you have an oven thermometer to verify that your oven is at the right temp? I have just recently had my oven fixed and they completely messed up the temp (about 50 degrees higher than it reads) so I’ve had to invest in the thermometer. It has made such a difference!

I am used to following recipes and we did except we substituted a few things. We used Rice Dream Drink for the nondairy milk and we used brown rice flour instead of the oat flour (they have allergies to oats too). The batter was SO dry and that was my first hint that it was going to fail. Anyways we were SO disappointed as it didn’t rise. The flavor wasn’t great! The kids didn’t like it, turned up their noses to it. It was super crumbly and hard to swallow!

Any time you swap out gf flours you run the risk of creating a more dry outcome, which is what happened with you. Oat flour is very close to regular flour in terms of the way it performs in a recipe and it also absorbs liquid differently (as do all gf flours). It sounds like it didn’t rise because one of 2 things: your yeast was old and/or the fact that the bread was too dense.[Reply](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2014/01/01/gluten-free-vegan-bread/?replytocom=265271#respond)			Ashley *says:*	[October 14, 2016 at 10:14 am](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2014/01/01/gluten-free-vegan-bread/#comment-257273)	Hi Cara –

I let the dough rise just to the top of the pan, stick it in the oven, and it falls almost immediately. My yeast is foams/proofs perfectly (I’ve tried 3 different types now), everything is warmed to 110*, I’m using the exact ingredients in the exact amounts, and my oven is the proper temperature. I’ve tried varying the amount of water and rise time like some have suggested, but the same thing happens every single time. Any help would be greatly appreciated.[Reply](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2014/01/01/gluten-free-vegan-bread/?replytocom=254104#respond)			JJ *says:*	[November 18, 2016 at 3:40 pm](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2014/01/01/gluten-free-vegan-bread/#comment-267251)	The major issue I run into with baking (especially gluten free) is altitude. If you live at higher altitude, then you are dealing with low pressure. Essentially, the lower the pressure, the faster water boils (or lower temperature that water boils at). This means that the liquid is boiling out of your recipe too soon, drying out your ingredients, making things not rise, etc. Also, high altitude causes issues with rise in breads.So its important to know what altitude the recipe was made for (most recipes are designed for sea level) and then look up the altitude where you live. (You can type your city into Google and the word altitude, and it gives you a pretty accurate number). After that, you can look up how to alter a recipe for the altitude you live at. Because if the altitude of my parents house, the gluten free wedding cake I tried to make had to be scrapped after 15 failed recipes for white cake, and I switches to a chocolate cake that only took 3 recipes until we finaly had a high altitude recipe.Good luck. Hope this helps.[Reply](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2014/01/01/gluten-free-vegan-bread/?replytocom=267251#respond)			Cat *says:*	[February 3, 2017 at 5:29 pm](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2014/01/01/gluten-free-vegan-bread/#comment-284875)	Andrew – Same problem. Try replacing 1/4 cup of the liquid with following (I used 1 cup water and 3/4 cup milk in the “liquid” part of Cara’s recipe): Take a can of garbanzo beans and drain off 1/4 of the brine (keep remaining brine in freezer for later batch and eat beans). Add 1/2 teaspoon of Cream of Tarter to the 1/4 cup brine. Whip about 5 minutes until it gets like thick whip cream. I found it whips faster if I refrigerate first and get a little cold. Also, it might whip faster with a stand mixer (I only have a hand mixer). Once all your bread ingredients are mixed together, take the brine fluff and fold it into the bread dough until barely mixed and then put dough in the prepared pan. Hope that works for you too!

Just made this today, have a slice already with lashings of butter (yummy!!), to top it off it rose beautifully (unlike my other attempts), with a great crust, so no more ‘tiny’ or ‘brick-like’ slices.One slight variation to the ingredients, since I didn’t have plain ground chia seeds, i used ‘Neat Egg’ which has chia and garbanzo and it worked well.Thanks again, keep posting those recipes.

I actually ended up dividing the dough into two separate bread pans, because the first time I tried it the dough overflowed my pan and I lost a bunch. I baked it for only half the time, and it was soft and delicious!Also tried using it for pizza dough, spreading it into two pizza pans, letting it rise and baking it for 15 minutes at 425. Then I topped and baked for another 15 minutes. Wonderful. Thanks so much for the great recipe.

Having some trouble getting the dough to rise. It rises before cooking and then settles down during baking and turns out crumbly and dense.

It rose both before and in the oven.I used Bob’s red mill GF mix, not the 1-1 stuff, and the designated amount of buckwheat flour. I didn’t have any milks other than full fat coconut, so I cut it in half with water to thin it, and I used coconut oil as my oil. Also, I used whole chia seeds. But… I did accidentally forget the salt! Whoops.

The first time was certainly my fault! To any readers out there getting a dense loaf…weigh your ingredients! That GF blend can really get packed into a measuring cup even if you are being careful! Also, ensure to measure chia seeds after grinding, not before! The second time I made this bread (this morning) by weighing out my ingredients, my dough turned out much more like you said it would, like a batter and not very thick like my last loaf. I had very high hopes! It rose well before baking, and then had the same problem as other readers where it fell in the oven. Not sure what I’ve done wrong…I will try only letting it rise for 30 minutes next time instead of 45, and maybe reduce the liquid by 1/4 Cup? Any other suggestions?

I’ve been drooling over this recipe for ages. A couple of questions, if I may:Firstly, how would using sprouted grain flours affect the outcome of this bread? I’ve never used sprouted flour before but I’m very much interested in utilizing them for gluten-free baking (to offset the lack of nutritional value in the starches)Secondly, and I do apologize if this has been asked but how do you think flax meal would work in lieu of chia seeds? Also, do they need to be ground?Thank you so much for all of your inspiring recipes!

After reading through the comments I decided to make a few adjustments:1. I cut the water down to 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup.
2. Instead of using 5 Tbsp of ground chia, I used 2 Tbsp ground chia + 2 Tbsp ground flax + 1 Tbsp of psyllium husk powder.
3. I used honey the second time instead of sugar. But I don’t think it should make a huge difference.I think that taking out that 1/4 of liquid really was the biggest help.I made this in bread machine BTW.
We have this bread machine, and I used the gluten free mode:[http://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-CBK-100-2-Pound-Programmable-Breadmaker/dp/B001C2KY7Y/ref=redir_mobile_desktop?ie=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0](http://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-CBK-100-2-Pound-Programmable-Breadmaker/dp/B001C2KY7Y/ref=redir_mobile_desktop?ie=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0)This was only the second loaf of bread I’ve ever made in this machine. We only recently purchased it and it’s the first one we’ve ever had.
I’ve never really been a baker (maybe an advantage in my case since I don’t have to overcome gluten free or vegan issues and unlearn traditional methods of baking) so I was pretty happy with the way my second loaf (with my recipe tweaks) of this came out.I was also pretty happy to be able to find all of the flours listed here at the local health food store, which I happen to work at. It’s a small store so I thought for sure that I’d have to go to more than one place but nope!
I’ve been gluten free for over twelve years now but never really got into baking because the idea of having so many different flours in my house was kind of intimidating. I also stopped eating many “bread” products since options over a decade ago seemed over priced, unappetizing and lacking in nutrients.
We’ve gone basically vegan in our house (excluding honey obviously) but trying to find commercially made bread products has held us back because almost all of them have eggs in them. My boyfriend’s a bit more of a bread eater than me but I can’t complain since he voluntarily offered to go GF when we moved in together.So anyway, thanks for the recipe! If anyone has any issues you could try some of the adjustments that I mentioned above.Here’s a photo of the second loaf that I just made today. I sprinkled a little extra ground flaxseed on the top before it started baking.

It’s warm and humid here.)The first time I tried the recipe I did not grind my chia seeds. Instead I used them whole.

It obviously did not.Both times, instead of using store-bought oat and millet flour, I ground my own oats and millet in the dry container of my Vitamix.

When it rises too much beforehand it seems to blow out, so to speak, and then it doesn’t have any rising left to do once it’s in the oven. So now I only let them rise until they are just about 3/4 doubled in size, if that makes sense. I think perhaps the warmth and humidity of your climate might speed the rising process as well.[Reply](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2014/01/01/gluten-free-vegan-bread/?replytocom=103689#respond)			Tammy *says:*	[March 10, 2015 at 7:50 pm](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2014/01/01/gluten-free-vegan-bread/#comment-97204)	Hi there, Just wondering if I can use grind up brown rice with ground oats, instead of the arrowroot flour and millet flour?

At that point, it’s a totally different recipe which I always encourage experimentation with different flours however I cannot guarantee it will work.

I realize it has been quite a while since this thread was posted, but I thought I would try out this question anyways:
My son also doesn’t tolerate gluten, oats, and eggs and I am desperate to find a good wholesome bread recipe for him. Have you had any luck yet? We all have to help each out, right? It is sometimes just madness trying to give our children a simple enjoyable chiled hood while avoiding many of the food other people rely on as staples![Reply](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2014/01/01/gluten-free-vegan-bread/?replytocom=119639#respond)			Francesca *says:*	[March 8, 2015 at 10:32 am](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2014/01/01/gluten-free-vegan-bread/#comment-96800)	Hi,
I’ve tried this bread a few times and each time it rises before I place it in the oven, but once in the oven it falls. The end result is dense loaf. I had to replace the oat flour as my son can’t tolerate oats, so i used your guidelines for making a blend and tried the combo with Sorghum flour, brown rice flour, tapioca starch, and arrowroot in the proportions you noted. I replaced buckwheat with brown rice flour as my son didn’t like the buckwheat version.I mixed the batter until just blended as the last time I though that perhaps, I oversized. I’m very new to GF baking, so any advice is greatly appreciated as to why I’m not getting the fluffy loaf you have pictured.
Thanks for any suggestions![Reply](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2014/01/01/gluten-free-vegan-bread/?replytocom=96800#respond)			Cara *says:*	[March 10, 2015 at 11:44 am](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2014/01/01/gluten-free-vegan-bread/#comment-97161)	Unfortunately it might be because of the replacement of the oat flour. The brown rice is a little more dense so it can have the tendency to weigh it down. What you can try is to up the amount of starch vs. grain in the flour blend, which will create a little more air/lightness. Also, how long does it take for your pre-heated bread to rise? Is it shorter than the recommended time on the recipe? Because part of the problem could be that due to where you live, the bread rises faster but if kept out longer than needed, it can cause it to deflate in the oven. One last thing, do you have an oven thermometer? Let’s start there [Reply](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2014/01/01/gluten-free-vegan-bread/?replytocom=97161#respond)			Franceca *says:*	[March 14, 2015 at 4:09 pm](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2014/01/01/gluten-free-vegan-bread/#comment-97835)	Thanks so much for the feedback. I would say that the bread rises in about 45 min and I actually don’t have an oven thermometer anymore (lost in a move), but I’ll get one to double check the temp. Thanks for the input about the flour – I’ll make some adjustments with the starch vs grain ratio. I really appreciate the suggestions.

Eggs can be substituted with “flax eggs” (1 Tbs ground flax + 3 Tbs water, leave for 10 min.) . You can also make chia seeds gel for natural thickener. Almond milk is super creamy and great for every dish, canned coconut milk is also thick and very nice, you can even make coconut whipped cream out of solid parts.

Great breadcrumbs if it goes wrong. d[Reply](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2014/01/01/gluten-free-vegan-bread/?replytocom=82094#respond)			Julianna *says:*	[October 25, 2014 at 6:56 pm](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2014/01/01/gluten-free-vegan-bread/#comment-81333)	Hello Cara!
I am new to vegan baking and extremely new to gluten free. I have been trying many different bread recipes all ending in epic failure. It is just very frustrating because I’ve made bread professionally in many different restaurants. I tried this recipe as well. I really liked the texture and how it wasn’t too dense.Can the buckwheat flour be replaces with another kind of flour because I realized I don’t care for the flavor. Also it seemed like it was a little starchy. I followed the recipe is there any reason why it would be that way?[Reply](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2014/01/01/gluten-free-vegan-bread/?replytocom=81333#respond)			Cara *says:*	[October 27, 2014 at 7:17 am](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2014/01/01/gluten-free-vegan-bread/#comment-81491)	Hi Julianna. Unfortunately everything that you once knew about baking tends to go right out of the door when you have to take out gluten, eggs, and dairy. It’s a whole new set of rules to follow so I totally understand the frustration! The thing about gluten-free flours is that they all have different weights and capacity to absorb liquid so when you replace flours you always run the risk of changing your outcome. Having said that, I always encourage experimentation! Go to the search button on the top of my site and look up guide to gluten-free flours and you will find a great resource for you. The starchy flavor just might be a personal preference. That guide will help you create a blend that best fits your needs. Hope that helps![Reply](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2014/01/01/gluten-free-vegan-bread/?replytocom=81491#respond)			Shannon *says:*	[November 27, 2014 at 10:49 am](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2014/01/01/gluten-free-vegan-bread/#comment-83791)	Julianna – I also don’t care for buckwheat – did you have any success with a substitute?

I used quinoa flour instead of buckwheat flour because that’s what I had on hand. It turned out great!

We are new to gluten free and I needed a bread that I could use in my grandmother’s southern cornbread dressing for our Canadian Thanksgiving this weekend. None of the grocery or bakery gf breads available around here (Saskatoon) would work. I made this last night and am very pleased with the results. I think it will mix beautifully with the cornbread and sage! I sure do appreciate all of your experimenting and sharing.

I have tried so many recipes! As a backup, just in case, I would suggest ordering the Katz GF All-Purpose Dough from Katz GF Bakery in Monroe. They ship. It’s the best GF pie crust I have ever had. I keep some on-hand in my freezer. It rolls out easily and is the best to work with that I have found. It always ends up flaky and delicious! The only drawback is the fluted edges of the crust end up browning more quickly than the rest…So I have to put foil around them to protect them, partway through cooking.Good luck![Reply](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2014/01/01/gluten-free-vegan-bread/?replytocom=80328#respond)			Cara *says:*	[October 13, 2014 at 4:21 pm](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2014/01/01/gluten-free-vegan-bread/#comment-80447)	You can do it!

Increased the sugar to 1 tablespoon.
Increased the baking soda to a full teaspoon.
Added 1 tsp of xanthum gum.
The rest of it I do exactly as the recipe states.
I do bake it in a bread maker on a gluten free setting. i just mix it all in a bowl and pour it into the bread maker.

I’m guessing it was way denser than yours from the description, but super good nonetheless. After reviewing all the comments I did add psyllium, and I needed to add a bit more liquid because it was very dry. I also baked it 10 minutes longer which appeared to be needed. Not sure of that’s because of my oven or the fact that I’m in Colorado, at 5600 feet. Would love to hear from you or anyone else about adjustments needed for GF baking, at altitude.

My last couple have been *perfect*, so here’s what I did:1. I added 1 tablespoon of psyllium husk powder to the batter–I think this helps give it a little more “hold” that you lose by not using eggs. It’s a lot thicker as a result but does not fall and the end state texture is really flexible.2. Used ground flax instead of chia. I don’t think this would make much difference but it’s what I have on hand and has been consistently successful.3. I only let it rise for 30 mins and not a second longer.4.

If your bread rises to fast it will sink in the middle. If it is too humid or hot in your house this could also cause it. Sometimes elevation is the issue. gf bread has no structure until it is cooked, so if it rises to high above the pan you will end up with half of your loaf burning in the bottom of the oven :(.

However, in comparison to the photos above, mine came out a little bit dense, not so airy with bubbles of air like yours, the top was quite crusty, which was nice, though the bottom was still a bit moist. I chucked it in the oven for a few min to bake up the sides.

Made this last night for my husband that recently have been diagnosed with sensitivity a for. Dairy, wheat, soy and bananas! I’ve tried a couple of bread recipts before this one and they have all been “cakey” instead of feeling like a loaf of bread. My 2 small problem whit this receipt was that the loaf sank in the middle mid through the baking. I’m getting a thermometer to check the temp of the oven. I usually bake all my breads on convection bake, but used the just Bake setting last night.. Second this was that it was really crumbly. Is there anything I can do about that? Did I not use enough liquid? Thankful for your repsond as I really want to find a great bread recipt for my husband.

Thank you for this recipe. I have been searching for a vegan and gluten free bread recipe. I made this last night and everything went smoothly, I had a nice foam with the yeast, the dough rose nicely. It looked beautiful coming out of the oven. I made it late at night, so I let it cool over night. I am not sure why but the top half of the bread is very crumbly and the bottom half is a little more dense. It is very hard to slice and falls apart on me. Any ideas why this could have happened? Also, the flavor was too “dark” for my taste, although delicious.

I do the mxing in bowls, since the chia seeds have to thicken up etc. Then I pour it in the machine and set it on the gluten free setting. I have learned to take the paddle out, since I don’t need it to mix the bread anyway. When I left it in, the middle of the bread fell in. It has turned out great in the machine. Much easier since you can pour it in and forget it and not have to wait for the rising to be over etc.
I like this bread better with the xanthum gum included. It is less crumbly. Flavor is very good.

A quick question re your flour mix as I’d like to make this bread. Here in New Zealand arrowroot powder and tapioca starch are seen as the same thing.

My daughter is newly gf and you know about all those store bought breads and how tasteless they are… so I found this recipe and thought I’d found my answer.Well…. it’s still in the oven. I wish I could attach a pic. First, let me say I followed the directions to the tee, with the exception of substituting brown rice flour for the oat flour. Made sure the water and milk were 100 degrees, yeast was fresh (it frothed), other ingredients were fresh, etc. etc. The bread rose too much, spilling over the edge of the pan. And now it’s completely caved in. I actually cried. Still want to cry some more, actually.Anyway, crying aside, why do you think it failed? I read the comments, the only thing I can think of is oven temp? I don’t have an oven thermometer… but the bread was rising too much anyway, prior to baking. Your thoughts?

No tears! Oh brother, I totally know this feeling of having your hopes up so high only to find them caving in like a loaf of gf/vegan bread  What it sounds like happened was that it was too hot (there was too much activity in the yeast). First off, where do you live? Let’s figure that out first. Things to try differently:
Cut back on your rising time (if you see that it’s already getting too high, you don’t need to let it sit for the required amount of time. Again, this might have everything to do with where you live).
Get a thermometer to check your oven’s temperatureTry it again  I know it’s frustrating (trust me–I KNOW this too well–ha!) but I promise you that I will help to make sure that your daughter can have a slice of homemade gf bread! xo, Cara[Reply](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2014/01/01/gluten-free-vegan-bread/?replytocom=36727#respond)			[Amanda](http://amandabrowningnutrition.weebly.com/) *says:*	[May 6, 2014 at 10:20 am](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2014/01/01/gluten-free-vegan-bread/#comment-38574)	I had the same thing happen to me (exactly!) but with no substitutions.

When I say rising, I mean RISING… it overflowed when I started baking it. I did make some subs (I used sorghum, millet, potato starch, and tapioca as my flour mixture; I also used flaxseed meal instead of chia). After it overflowed (yes, I had to quickly try to clean the overflowed chunks out of the bottom of my oven before they caught fire…lol), it totally deflated. Boo!! I have about 15 minutes of baking time left and am hopeful that it is at least salvageable. Any thoughts on why I encountered this issue? Was it the subs I used?[Reply](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2014/01/01/gluten-free-vegan-bread/?replytocom=36521#respond)			Cara *says:*	[March 23, 2014 at 8:56 am](http://www.forkandbeans.com/2014/01/01/gluten-free-vegan-bread/#comment-36623)	Oh no! What a total bummer  PS I love that you went to work immediately though. ha! That’s my kind of gal.
Okay so what I am thinking is that this is a heat issue. You had too much rise activity going on and then too much heat which immediately killed it off (enter deflation). Not sure why it overflowed though but I’m thinking you should get a thermometer to measure your oven’s heat to ensure it’s at the right temp. Try that first and I will do some more research as to why it overflowed so dang much!

I have been giving it some thought since yesterday and I think you hit the nail on the head. I heated my oven to 200 degrees and turned it off while I was prepping the dough (actually, mine had more the consistency of batter). I then placed the pan in the probably-too-warm oven to rise. I used this method b/c it was recommended for another recipe I once tried, but was not right for this one. Happily, I was able to salvage about 8 nice slices and – most importantly – it was the BEST tasting GF bread I have tried!

I’m so sorry your loaf didn’t rise–what a flippin’ bummer  Here are some of thoughts as to why it didn’t, and it’s exactly the direction you were going. Check your yeast and baking powder to make sure it’s still good–also it could be an oven temperature issue.

I waited about an hour (mind you I live in Asia so it is warmer here). Anyway — my yeast was newly opened from its package and I checked the expiration date. As for my baking powder, I had just opened that last Feb and works fine with my other baked goods! Could it be my water or non dairy milk was to warm? Or that I had not mixed my yeast-dugar-milk enough? I hope you can help me out and let me know what else I could do next time I try your recipe..

It should have risen while it was on the counter so there is our issue. Your water and nondairy milk need to be at least lukewarm but if you have a thermometer, check it at 100*F. Don’t go too hot or it will kill the yeast. Did the yeast puff up while it sat in the water for the first 10 minutes? If not, it’s your yeast. It’s always a bad indicator when it doesn’t “proof”–it says your yeast is no good. Do you have a non-drafty spot in your kitchen that isn’t super hot? I like to place the loaf in my oven that is NOT turned on.

Usually I give a good substitute however chia seeds are imperative for this particular recipe. The amount of chia allows for no xanthan gum and I really strongly suggest waiting to order some seeds before making this.

I too had to make a substitution with my flours (and have no idea what I’m doing – I’m a newbie) I made a mix with coconut, white rice and sorghum flours to replace the millet flour. I only have regular chia seeds too. Other then that, followed the recipe, it it delicious! Mine didn’t raise like yours, but it looks really pretty with the chia seeds and is really moist. (I may need to let it raise longer) Tastes so much better then the gluten free vegan bread I buy at the store. I will buy millet flour to try it next time.

Do you know it I could use that in place of the arrowroot and if so what quantity? I saw online that when making bread you should use 2 teaspoons of instant ClearJel per 3 cups of flour. That seems like a lot less in total dry ingredients.
