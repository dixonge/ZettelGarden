# Easy Sourdough Starter

[[Easy%20Sourdough%20Starter%20aca8a6d6006e48728b83413cc45aed77 untitled]]

The recipe that excites me most in our latest book, The [The New Healthy Bread in Five Minutes a Da](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1250077559/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1250077559&linkCode=as2&tag=arbrinfimiada-20&linkId=094e388d0cd098fb4882d2e02ae3a3bb)y, is the easy Sourdough Starter. I’m an admitted baking geek, so spending hours on a recipe can be exciting to me, but I know this concept sounds like work to some and just terrifies others. That’s why Jeff and I set out to write these books in the first place, being able to compel busy people to bake bread at home has been our mission. Now you can also create a sourdough starter; easily, without fear and without dedicating your whole day to the project. In fact, it only takes a few minutes a day to get your starter up and running. It really is that easy, but it takes several days to get your starter strong enough to actually use in a batch of bread. Until it is ready to go, you can always bake any of the other yeast filled recipes in our books.

All you need to make your sourdough starter is flour, water and a container to keep it in. Nothing special or fancy. Just make sure the container can hold at least two quarts of starter. You’ll see some Baking Bloopers below of what happens if your container is too small.

Once you have created your starter you can use it to bake beautiful loaves, with or without added yeast. The flavor is incredible and you will still be making a large batch of dough and storing it for up to a week, so you will do the work on one day for many loaves.

To make the starter:

[[Easy%20Sourdough%20Starter%20aca8a6d6006e48728b83413cc45aed77 untitled%202]]

**Day 1:** In a clean [Jar](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001BMYHA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0001BMYHA&linkCode=as2&tag=arbrinfimiada-20&linkId=255772b9401afb1ad266524b57206db0) or container* add 1/2 cup flour (unbleached white, whole wheat, rye, brown rice) and 1/2 cup water. That’s it.

*the jar needs to be big enough to hold 2 quarts and it needs to be open to the air, since you want to gather the natural yeasts from the flour and the environment. If you seal your jar, you won’t collect the yeast and/or the jar may actually explode. Yes, I said explode, see picture at the bottom of the post.

Stir the flour and water. Let this mixture sit for 2 days on the counter at room temperature.

**Day 3:** You should see bubbles forming in the starter. That’s the sign you are off to a great start. If you don’t see any bubbles on day 3, leave it for another day.

[[Easy%20Sourdough%20Starter%20aca8a6d6006e48728b83413cc45aed77 untitled%205]]

If you have bubbles, add 1/2 cup flour (you don’t have to stick to the same kind you used on the first day I like to make mine with a combination of whole wheat, rye and white flour) and 1/2 cup water. Str together and let sit for one day.

[[Easy%20Sourdough%20Starter%20aca8a6d6006e48728b83413cc45aed77 untitled%206]]

**Day 4, 5, 6:** Add 1/2 cup flour and water to the jar and stir on each of these days to build the strength of your starter. Let sit at room temperature after stirring.

[[Easy%20Sourdough%20Starter%20aca8a6d6006e48728b83413cc45aed77 untitled%207]]

By the 6th day your starter should seem mildly bubbly and it will have a pleasant sour smell building up. Add more flour and water so you have at least 3 1/2 cups of starter to use in a batch of dough.

**Day 7:** Once it is nice and strong, the starter will look foamy and

[[Easy%20Sourdough%20Starter%20aca8a6d6006e48728b83413cc45aed77 untitled%209]]

if your container isn’t big enough, the starter may try to escape. You’ll notice I never snap the jar shut.

Now you are ready to use the starter in any of our recipes.

Here is a basic rule to using sourdough in your recipes, but for WAY more information and specific recipes check out chapter 11 of [The New Healthy Bread in Five Minutes a Day](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1250077559/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1250077559&linkCode=as2&tag=arbrinfimiada-20&linkId=094e388d0cd098fb4882d2e02ae3a3bb). You will also find information about how to store your sourdough long term and how to reactivate it if you haven’t used it in many months.

**To bake with your starter:** Use about 3 cups of the activated sourdough starter for a full-batch of dough, which make 4 to 5 pounds of dough. This means that you need to decrease the water in the recipes by 1 1/2 cups, and the flour by 1 1/2 cups. Adjust the water and flour to create a dough that looks and feels just like what you get with our yeast-based recipes. Depending on the strength of your sourdough starter it may take 2-12 hours for your dough to rise. This slow rise is part of the beauty of a natural lavain bread.

If you want to use your sourdough in combination with commercial yeast, you can use half as much starter (replacing just 3/4 cup flour and 3/4 cup water). Some people like the lighter sour flavor and it gives beginner bakers a sense of insurance to add the yeast.

Shape and bake as you would any of our recipes.

This why you never want to use a screw top glass jar for your starter. If you have a really large glass jar that will fit the dough, be sure to poke a hole in the top of the lid so the gas from the yeast can escape.
