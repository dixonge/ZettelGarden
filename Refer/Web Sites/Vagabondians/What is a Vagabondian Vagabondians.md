# What is a Vagabondian?

I think that is a fair question. To be honest, just saying it out loud — “What is a Vagabondian?” makes me laugh. It is a silly word, is it not? But do we even know what a Vagabond is? To some it is a poor tramp, a hobo. To others it is someone who wanders and travels. And to be honest, I had something closer to this last meaning in mind when I coined the word. OK, so a few people have used it before me, but not in a web site name.

So what is a vagabondian? Someone who travels, who wanders. An explorer. More precisely, someone who has an affinity for that sort of life. So there you have it. What is a Vagabondian? A Vagabondian is someone who enjoys the life of a Vagabond and the company of other like-minded Vagabonds.

But really, I just made it up. I thought it sounded a bit quirky, unique. Do you agree?
