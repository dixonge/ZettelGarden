Use these codes to insert flickr sets and photos or youtube videos - just paste the URL in-between the quotation marks

[flickr url=""]

[youtube url=""]

After you finish, tag the note as 'published' - also tag it with one or more of these tags as a category - no capitalization, no spaces:

mexico

centralamerica

there are other categories, but mostly for older things you probably won't be writing on :)
