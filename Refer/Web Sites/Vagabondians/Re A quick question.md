Hey Glenn,

We had an embedded Google Map for some time, but decided to switch over to Tripline.net ([http://www.tripline.net/trip/Our_Travels_to_Date-2421703233111005B249A015E8DD8853](http://www.tripline.net/trip/Our_Travels_to_Date-2421703233111005B249A015E8DD8853)) and we have an embedded map in this page -Â [http://www.marriedwithluggage.com/our-story/our-trip-map/](http://www.marriedwithluggage.com/our-story/our-trip-map/). I should spend some time making this bigger but right now we simply link out to Tripline to see the full map and all our locations. Since we do not write about travel per se this is a lower priority, but something I continue to update with each new experience.

Things here are well. Spanish, as you all are well aware, is slower going when you are a couple working and writing. I spend too much time talking English and not enough engaging with others. Monday I'm going to meet with a woman at a bar we've gotten to know for an intercambio of English and Spanish. I'm hoping that helps speed me along.

Otherwise, life is well here. We're starting to get itchy feet, but this is quite common as I am sure you and Dixie are aware. We may end up leaving before the rainy season and head to Europe for some long hikes. Alas, all is open right now.

How are you all enjoying being back in the US? How are you finding the re-entry?
