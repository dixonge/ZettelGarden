# General goal/vision thoughts

When we first began dreaming about all of this, what really appealed to us? To be honest, the main appeal was to be free from the daily grind. 9-5, every day, every week, every month, every year for the rest of the best part of our lives!

Did we really want to sacrifice the "rest of the best" on the altar of the conventional lifestyle?

The conventional lifestyle had a goal - secure retirement. But if you look at it from a different perspective, it is a goal which only a corporation could love. Give us an average of 50 hours per week (if you include commuting, lunch, etc.) for at least 20 of your 'best' years or possibly up to 40 years. In exchange, we will give you:

- Money to keep up with the Jones' - you can use it to pay off your massive debt: student loans, car loans, home mortgage, etc.
- Health insurance you will rarely use, but which might help prevent bankruptcy in the case of a major problem (or not)
- Vacation days for unwinding from all the job stress, unless you have to use them for when your kid is sick or school is closed.
- Some form of retirement funding mechanism with no guarantees. You might lose a lot of money in the stock market, and we might shut down our pension program.
- In the end, especially if you haven't moved and you've paid off your mortgage, you can stay in that same house for your 'golden' years.
- Also, if you have any money left over and haven't developed any crippling diseases of aging, you can travel more, like maybe TWO times a year!

This is the average life for the average American. And yet we were doing much better than average! When we left our jobs we had a gross annual salary of just over $126,000, which put us in the top twelve percent. As I type that, it shocks me, even now. Our life was much better than the 'average' American. Dixie was taking home the second-highest salary level at our employer. Most of our co-workers had salaries like mine, coming in at around half of my wife's. And yet we all had very stable jobs with very little threat of being laid off or fired. We also had a 2-year freeze on both new hires and pay raises. We were definitely living an above-average lifestyle, but what did we have to show for it?

A mortgage, two cars, two motorcycles, a moderate amount of other debt and ZERO in savings. And in that way, we were very much the average American.

One other item which helped to shock us into action was a statement we ran across somewhere about how most in the Western world will earn a million dollars in their lifetimes. A million? It seemed a bit preposterous, but Dixie and I went through our Social Security statement totals and it was true. As a matter of fact, we had already done it! A million dollars. Sure, you have to take into account income tax and deductions for Social Security and Medicare, but still - that was a lot of money. And what did we have to show for it?

We looked around. On the asset side we had vehicles and a lot of 'stuff' but none of it was anything you would consider an investment. Everything we owned was a depreciating asset except for our home, which had a large mortgage attached to it. It was basically a net neutral asset scenario.

As we were hitting our stride and approaching our 50's, our net worth was under $10,000, and we would only realize that amount if we sold everything we owned and paid off all our debt.

As we looked at this scenario we came to some conclusions. It was obvious to us that at a bare minimum we needed to get out of debt and save back money. We *should* have been doing this all along, but we had been lulled into a nice state of 'comfortably numb.' We also saw that we needed to cut back on our expenses if we wanted to change any part of our lives in the near future.

So we did.

Everything I have written here has been stated before on the blog, in bits and pieces. But everything else we have done since we quit our jobs and 'ran away from home' hinged on this early assessment. Everyone dreams of traveling the world, but most never do. The most that the average person can hope for is to pick a spot and travel there on the annual family vacation. It is one way of achieving a travel goal, but our goals became more ambitious. One valid question to ask when thinking about leaving it all behind is "Well NOW what?" What would one do with one's time if they no longer had a job to go to every day? For us the answer was to go and see, travel the world. But that was not our primary motivation. We only began compiling a list of 'must-see' items after we set our goal of saving back money and leaving our jobs. Not having to work for someone else every day was the primary goal, the travel is simply a bonus. In other words, our main goal and focus transformed our thinking. Once it was under way, other goals and desires surfaced. Only when we had a concrete plan to
