# A Brief Summary

[[2013%20-%20A%20Brief%20Summary%20Vagabondians%2040ba97f78c934cb2a4a55a7418df1941 untitled]]

So 2013 was a pretty interesting year. We started in Mexico, visited Belize, spent five months back in Texas, visited Nicaragua, visited Costa Rica, then ended up right back in Mexico! We’ve spent the last few weeks in sunny Merida.

So far, that’s the most countries we’ve ever visited in one year. In 2014 we’ll visit at least Mexico and Guatemala, not sure beyond that.

So – let’s do this!
