- [ ]  CASE STUDIES - sprinkle throughout - anonymize them, but make them about real people
- [ ]  Include some acknowledgement and set of options for those hit by the recession - if you lose your job, how to escape the system before it destroys your life. How this Exit Plan can recession-proof your life! Bankruptcy can be a helpful tool. The trap of all mortgage assistance programs. Staying in your home until eviction can help you get out of all other debt or save up a lot of money. Walking away can free you from both the payments *and* all of the extra expenses (utilities, maintenance, taxes, insurance) but you'll need to pay rent. Need spreadsheets/tables on all of these!
- [ ]  Scenarios to cover in promotional material, FAQ, etc. - What if I just lost my job? What if I am behind on my mortgage? What if I just got a foreclosure notice?
- [ ]  IDEA: Timeline or FLOWCHART for "Is this book for me?" - include several scenarios, flowchart through and discuss whether or not this book still might be fore you

Chapter 1 - Examine Your Options

- [ ]  Add discussion on balance - liabilities vs assets - how even assets come with a price, a cost, to your freedom - talk about the balance of factors - most discussions are about increasing one's income - but much less income is required when you reduce your expenses - think outside the box here - debts and mortgages are an expense - a fully-paid off home is an expense - vehicles are an expense - where you live greatly influences your expenses - there are many, MANY choices we could make to reduce expenses, if we really wanted to. Once you begin thinking outside the box, the options and choices available to you begin to unfold. What was once a pipe dream, a fantasy available only to the elite, the rich and famous, now begins to look doable. You can have the best of both worlds, if you want.
- [ ]  Some of this is already in Chapter 7 - perhaps move that to the beginning?

Chapter 2 - Erase Your Debt

- [ ]  Title Page Image
- [ ]  Revise 'goals' section - line up with Chapter 1
- [ ]  Budgeting software/apps/spreadsheets links
- [ ]  Debt Snowball spreadsheet - Google docs? -
- [ ]  Table showing our initial balances
- [ ]  Go into details re: our own bankruptcy?

Chapter 3 - Evict Your Things

- [ ]  Title Page Image
- [ ]  Clutter/Storage Infographics (from Married w/ Luggage?)
- [ ]  Include anecdotal story about estate sale
