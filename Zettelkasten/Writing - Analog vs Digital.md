In a classroom setting (taking notes of live audio/video) typing gets more original words down, but leaves you no time to process and restate/synthesize the topic. Paper notes gives you this time, plus the memory benefits that comes from writing (need to look this up to verify). Additional benefit, sketching or drawing out a shape (in school, this would help in chemistry/biology/geometry).

According to Sascha and Christian, this also applies to notes for reading.
