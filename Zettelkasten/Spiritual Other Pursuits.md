## Things I have tried + motivation

- Tarot cards - non-spiritual application
- Meditation - coping mechanism for ADHD
- Satanism - ritual? Not sure what attracted me
- Yoga - mostly physical, annoyed at chakras, etc.
- Tai-Chi - balance, coordination, fluidity of movement
- Salvia - curiosity, to know what this whole 'psychedelic' experience is all about
