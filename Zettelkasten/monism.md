# Monism

Attributes oneness or singleness to a concept - a term specific to philosophy.

Philosophical monism is generally used in Western philosophy to typify positions in the ‘mind-body problem’

It was introduced in the 18th century by Christian von Wolff in his work *Logic* to refer to the attempt to eliminate the dichotomy of body and mind - to explain all phenomena by a unifying principle, of a single substance
