# Random Thoughts

> I want to erase every last trace of my christian fundamentalist brainwashing. All effects, psychological, behavioral, etc. Today’s thought - giving. Originally I gave out of spiritual compulsion, obeying the orders of a non-existent god. At one point we gave 10% of our gross income, which our tax software pointed out was at the extreme margin for the U.S. population. It felt good to help other organizations to ‘spread the gospel.’After becoming atheist, we give much less and only to certain causes we deem worthy, or to random panhandlers, but it is without any sort of plan or ethical framework. Our motivation is no longer based on ancient man-made religions, but neither does it have structure or guidance. What is a logical motivational framework for giving to and helping others? It would be generally humanistic and ethical, but I need to flesh that out.And this exercise should be repeated for all areas of life. Not just randomly, as in “hey, I am still doing X with a christian mindset, I should rethink that!” but systematically.What will my children write about me in their memoirs?Bruce Chatwin is the patron saint of wanderers.Play the hand you’re dealt - but what if you’ve been given the wrong rules?
