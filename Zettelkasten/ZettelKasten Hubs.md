## Reading method

- Luhmann created excerpts and a list of thoughts w/ references to book pages
- Later he separated points to individual Zettels and decided where to put it (in his cabinets)

So I take this to mean that his numbering system became a de facto category index, in a sense?

Unlike normal 'academic' reading, you are not attempting to understand the author, you are attempting to fill your archive with meaningful thoughts and how to improve your ZK's content/connections. IOW, you are 'collecting' thoughts/content!

## ZettelkÃ¤sten Structure

Big topic > smaller topic > side thoughts

Where do new Zettels go? Near related zettels. Should have *some* connection to previous zettel. Results in topics spread out in different places. This makes the *physical* archive easier to use - can think about structure separately, if ever.

But your topics are spread out. This helped Luhmann explore interesting connections. Folgezettels (follow-up slips) were key.

## Folgezettels don't matter

Follow-up slips seem to be key to finding zettels again, but this is not needed in a digital ZK. Luhmann stated that it doesn't matter where a zettel is as long as you can find it.

## Hubs

Luhmann had zettels that only contained extensive lists of links to his core zettels. Not essential in digital ZK, but useful for other purposes. (outlines, overviews)
