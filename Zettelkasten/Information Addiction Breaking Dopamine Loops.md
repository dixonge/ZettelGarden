Pairing cues **such as sounds** with arrival of information motivates people to seek it more. Giving small bits of information and then providing a way for people to get more information results in increased information-seeking behavior. The more unpredictable nature of the arrival of information is, the more people will be addicted to seeking it. This is how **casinos, apps and video games** get you addicted.
