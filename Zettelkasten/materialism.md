# Materialism

A form of philosophical [[monism]] - holds that matter is the fundamental substance in nature. All things, including consciousness, are results of material interactions. Contrasts with ‘idealism.’

Physicalism is now the preferred term by some, or seen as synonymous.

PanPsychism is a contradictory philosophy.
