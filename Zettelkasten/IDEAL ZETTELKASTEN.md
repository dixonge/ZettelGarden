File-based - keeps w/ atomicity principle
Text-based - keeps things as portable/cross-platform as possible
Auto-preview inline - makes writing easier, see results immediately
- also keeps you in 'view' mode, as if you are browsing vs never-ending-editing
Markdown? - YAML? - I like these features, but it needs to 'just work' instead of constantly revising these things to match the new editor
Difficult to balance tools/functionality side w/ UI side - need to *find* things easy
Examples - books - need both list and grid views
