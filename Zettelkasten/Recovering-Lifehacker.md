# Confessions of a recovering lifehacker

“Maybe all the time I spend looking for better ways to do things is keeping me from, well, doing things.”

“That’s because most of the stuff that pours out of these sites isn’t really about hacking your life. It’s about constantly fiddling around with all the bullshit that too often gets in the way of your life:”

“But is that really the way you want to think about your life?”

I think lifehacking is so seductive because it’s simply easier than asking some bigger, harder, more important questions about where your time and attention go.

1. **Less lifehacking, more life-designing.**
2. This has nothing to do with being artsy. It just means: start from scratch, question assumptions, and imagine outcomes. The point is that you envision what you *want* to do/be/happen first — not tools, process, defaults, or “what’s possible.” It’s hard, but it clarifies what’s real right up front, when it matters most.

When you assume that what you’ve got in-hand, right now, is good enough, you stay focused on doing — not fiddling.

The least possible (practical) amount of organization is best.

above a certain threshold, imposing more order on a system detracts from its effectiveness.

1. **You are very important, but only to certain people. Make sure you identify them correctly.**
2. Why do I check my inbox, twitter feed, smartphone notifications, and blog stats like a crack fiend? Because **I really like feeling important.** I like getting messages instantly because their manufactured urgency makes me feel like my attention is a hot commodity clamored for by thronging masses. And it’s true: my attention *is* a hot commodity. But not to 95% of the people behind those dings and pings. They don’t really care about me or my attention at all, other than as a means to their own ends. If I emailed them back right now, or two hours from now, tomorrow, never — it very well might make no real difference in the big picture. You know who does care about my attention? My wife. My friends (and not the Facebook variety). The family members I don’t call often enough. To them, I actually *am* important. Why not act accordingly?
