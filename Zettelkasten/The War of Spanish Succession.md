King Carlos II of Spain, died childless, named the son of his half-sister to succeed him (Philip of Anjou). Disputes over this and partitioning led to the war. Britain, the Dutch Republic, the Holy Roman Emperor and various German states form a 'Grand Alliance' and declared war on France in 1702. This ended with the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 and the Treaty of Rastatt in 1714. Many borders changed in Europe and the New World.
