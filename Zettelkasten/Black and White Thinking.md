If you fall into some of these patterns, you may be engaging in black and white thinking:

- You tend to see things as zero-sum games: if someone is winning, someone else must be losing. You don't tend to seek out compromises or arrangements where everyone wins.
- If someone does bad things you assume it must be for bad motivations, and if someone does good things you assume it must be for good motivations. It is hard for you to understand how people could be impacted by their circumstances and limited knowledge to make choices that seem right to them that are not right to you. This may manifest in you preferring a very punitive system of justice, either criminal or just interpersonal.
- You have a hard time tolerating flaws. If a person, piece of media, story, philosophy etc has some flaws then, even if parts of it are good or useful, you feel that it is terrible and no one should appreciate or respect it.
- You have a hard time understanding where boundaries of thought lie between yourself and others. If you like or dislike something you expect or assume that everyone else will as well, and it bothers you if they don't mirror your feelings on the matter.
- You tend to cast people into simplified roles in your mind and are resistant to changing them. People are either victims or abusers, either smart or stupid, either successful or losers. You tend not to notice the ways in which people may fulfill both of those roles simultaneously or neither of them.
- You have a hard time accepting that people can change over time.
- You may feel distressed when things aren't being done A Certain Way, and feel persistently certain that your way of doing things is better, even if you cannot actually know that for sure.

These are a few questions you can ask yourself to get a read on your thought processes. Of course, everyone has limits at which they assign things into either black or white categories and that's not a bad thing. You might say "I'm generally willing to try to be sympathetic and understanding of people, but there are some people who go too far." You might say, "I'm fine with people having different opinions than me, but some opinions are so awful, I don't want to be around that person." Or "I understand that people can change, but this person has done so many horrible things, I think they should still suffer consequences." Everyone has limits and that's a good thing. Becoming so wishy-washy and focused on withholding judgment on everything isn't actually admirable. But, if you find that the bullet points above reflect a very common thought p
