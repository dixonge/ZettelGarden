1. Start with a 'master' to-do list - small units - prioritize with:
- A - Important
- B - If I have time
- C - Fat chance
1. Prep your Planner
How much time is actually available? Write out all date-and-time specific items. (Spanish lessons, ukelele playing time, trash/water day, meals, groceries, walking etc.)
2. Put it all together
- Plan a bit less than you *could* do, give yourself a cushion
- Mix *high-* and *low-*brain activities
- Time outdoors each day - 'green' time is important

Capture new items on phone or list - transfer to master list at home

Once a week re-prioritize master list - drop C items as needed, or do them when you're bored and nothing else is going on.
