This blog post seems to be Nate Eliason summarizing/applying SÃ¶nke Ahrens' book.

## Core Idea

Simply extracting highlights is a waste of time. Create a ZK note, include the quote if you wish, but add your thoughts - synthesize what you are thinking. Your notes should have context as important to *you*, not to the book. Helps generate more ideas and put them to use.

## Step 1 - Physical Notes

Helps to force you to put notes in your own words. Better memory, theoretically.

## Step 2 - Record biblio source

Nate captures the highlight as well as creating a note.

## Step 3 - Upload your notes

Scan highlights from digital book using Readwise.

Important question is: make the note/idea detailed enough to stand on its own.

## Step 4 - File your notes

Tag w/ book source and topics. Split into atomic notes.

## Step 5 - USE and Organize
