Connections:

- Paper - linear is better than chronological (like BuJo)
- Digital - can become dumping ground [collector's fallacy](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/)
    - files/folders become forgotten and collect digital dust
- Mind Maps, outlines, etc. - limited to small set of ideas
- Tags/categories - connect notes, but each is still eventually a large set

Surprisal - measure of amount of information exchanged when two entities communicate
Claude Shannon - How much information is contained in a message is determined by how *surprising* the message is.

Most non-linear note-taking strategies benefit learning better than linear.

System:

- forces you to write, synthesizing ideas as you read or think
- forces you to look for existing notes to link to
- can store a train of thought, a sequence of ideas

Systematic *way* to research, structure your knowledge, and develop your thinking - ultimately generate new ideas.

Two advantages:

1. Process automates, eliminates need to think too much about what to do next
2. New ideas are essential for non-fiction writers

Great tool for creativity

"every novel idea is a remix"

Zettelkasten Principles:

1. [[]] - one idea per note
2. [[]] - self-contained
3. Always link
4. Explain - why linked?
5. Use your own words
6. Keep references
7. Add your own thoughts
8. Don't worry about structure
9. Add connection notes - separate note to explain link relationships
10. Add outline notes - sequence of links to other notes - in order to create story, narrative or argument
11. Never delete! - link to new note that explains the problem with the old note
12. Add notes without fear - you can *never* have too many
