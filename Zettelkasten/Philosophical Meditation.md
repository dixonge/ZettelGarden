Ritual coined by Alain de Botton

Time: Either early morning or late evening

Tools: Paper/pen

Goal: Filter out important stuff from messy pile of unresolved thoughts

Technique: 3 Questions

1. What am I anxious about?
2. What am I upset about, and with whom?
3. What am I currently feeling excited or ambitious about?

At first, no clear answers, BUT - the questions will still trigger emotional responses - mental images/phrases will come to mind, those are valuable clues. Write these down, even if they don't make sense individually.

Follow-up questions:

Upset:

- Retell in great detail
- What scared you?
- How have you been hurt?
- What good part of yourself feels in danger?
- How might a nice person have ended up doing what this person did to you? If they weren’t actively mean, what other explanations could there be for the hurt they have caused?
- If this were to carry on, what might be the catastrophe?
- What are you afraid might happen if this were to continue?
- Have you been affected like this before?
- If you had to pin down an incident in the past that this somehow reminds you of, what would it be? Is there a pattern here?
- If this had happened to a friend, how would you advise them?
- What might you be able to learn from this upset?

Anxiety:

- Tell the story of the coming anxious period in great detail and say exactly what you imagine might go wrong?
- What would happen to you if it all went wrong?
- If this thing were to keeping getting worse, then...
- The danger here is that...
- How might you still be OK, even if it was all absolutely terrible?
- How would the person you’d like to be ideally deal with this situation?
- What previous situation does this remind you of? Have you been in something like this before?
- What happened in the past?
- What helped in the past

Excitement:

- Describe your excitement as if to a sympathetic, interested friend.
- You need to change your life in certain ways: what would it be to change your life in the light of this?
- What are the good things contained here?
- Humans have an impulse towards growth: what call to growth is here in a garbled form?
- This exciting thing holds a clue to what is missing in my life; what might be missing?
- When else have you felt something similar?
- If this thing could talk, what might it tell me?
- If this thing could try to change my life, what changes might it advise?
- If other parts of my life were more like this, what might they be like?
