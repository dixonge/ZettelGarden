My Review: It took me a few false starts before I finally grasped what was going on and was able to break through the dense opening chapters. Once that was accomplished, a fascinating story unfolded. I think I read a synopsis somewhere that helped me to get it, something about the restriction of technology (due to a war in the distant past) by putting different fields of study in different sequestered cloisters, with outside conversations allowed only at varying intervals of years. Once I understood that basic plot setup, the early part of the book made a lot more sense! Really great story.
