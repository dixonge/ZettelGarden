Here are a few questions to begin your personal search. Your answers will identify what is most important to you. Ask yourself:

*What has motivated me to overcome my challenges?*

*What kinds of activities have I been drawn to over and over?*

*What was so engrossing that it made the day fly by?*

*What have I done in my spare time that I enjoyed?*

*What are the topics of movies, books and lectures that Iâ€™m drawn to?*
