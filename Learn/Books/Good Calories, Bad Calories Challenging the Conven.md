My Review: I am leaving my originsl review of this book here (below) but ten years later and I have completely, utterly changed my mind. This book is generally bullshit.<br/><br/>Taubes makes critical errors throughout. The voluminous footnotes gives the appearance of a thorough researcher, but given that he generally misinterprets, slants and selectively quotes them all, the volume only serves to mask his bias. His foundation is equally problematic. Here is a <a href="http://anthonycolpo.com/the-art-of-bullshit-part-1-gary-taubes-and-nusi/">very thorough recap</a><br/><br/>The current science shows that <a href="https://examine.com/nutrition/low-fat-vs-low-carb-for-weight-loss/">the makeup of the diet doesn't really matter.</a> In other words, in the end, it really is just Calories In/Calories Out.<br/><br/><hr><br/>NOTE: This review (below) is old and completely wrong. I leave it here as a reminder of how easy it is for authors to mislead<br/>-----<br/>Still in the first part of this book, but so far it is a thorough overview of the history of medical research into diet.  It has almost completely shattered my view of the state of government-funded research in America.  It is disturbing to discover that everything you have heard about healthy eating your whole life might be totally wrong.
