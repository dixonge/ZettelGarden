    - Secret ballot

        Lysander Spooner, 19th century abolitionist and essayist, pointed out that the secret ballot undermines the State’s claims of legitimacy, because it can’t be proved that any particular individuals ever voted for it:

        As all voting is secret (by secret ballot), and as all secret governments are necessarily only secret bands of robbers, tyrants, and murderers, the general fact that our government is practically carried on by means of such voting, only proves that there is among us a secret band of robbers, tyrants, and murderers … . *[No Treason. № VI. The Constitution of No Authority, 1870](https://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/www/spooner/NoTreason/)*

        A common argument for a secret ballot is that it protects people from having their vote coerced by employers, dominating spouses, etc. In my opinion, this concern is outweighed by the real and present evil of allowing people to hide their identities while conspiring against their neighbors. In any case, if voting did not exist, the question would not even arise.

    Vegetarians abstain from eating meat, because they believe there are morally troubling aspects to it that weigh against benefits in tastiness and maybe health. And they do this knowing full well that any individual’s decision to not eat meat likely won’t save the life of a single animal. Yet we don’t take this as evidence that they’re behaving irrationally.

- Why Quakers Stopped Voting

    [Why Quakers Stopped Voting - Paul Buckley](https://www.friendsjournal.org/quakers-stopped-voting/)

    governments by their nature are violent—all use coercion and military force to achieve their goals

    Voting creates a contractual relationship. In exchange for the right to vote, the voter confers legitimacy on the resulting government. Voters grant the election winners the right to act on their behalf. The government speaks in the name of all, not just those who favored the victors. Friends in the eighteenth century realized one implication of voting was that when the resulting government waged war, it was entitled to act in the name of all those who voted. Every voter bore an equal share of guilt for the blood spilled. To Friends, voting ensnared them in an inherently violent and corrupt system. Complete withdrawal seemed the only acceptable option.
