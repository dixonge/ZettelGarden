Some notes:

> “Our anti-intellectualism”, wrote historian Richard Hofstadter, “is older than our national identity”. In 1964, Hofstadter’s book, Anti-Intellectualism in American Life, won the Pulitzer Prize in non-fiction and became the seminal text on the subject. Hofstadter correctly identified three types of anti-intellectualism: evangelical religion (religious anti-rationalism); practical-minded business (unreflected instrumentalism); and a populist political style (populist anti-elitism).
