A lot of really great info, but possibly some hype. Need to double-check some of the claims, but overall interesting docu, lots of great visualizations and I enjoyed the personification of fungi via the narrator's voice.

Spot-check reveals perhaps more hype than is warranted, especially w/ magical cures of cancer, anti-bacterial properties, etc.
