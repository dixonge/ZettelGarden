# Tech Simplification

Done: No
Status: In Progress

**Technologies and Services to simplify for future-proofing and sustainability:*Raspberry Pi - Maybe limit it to a test-bed and/or non-essential projects (miniflux) - nothing needed for any legacy or importance - nothing anyone would miss if I were goneeBooks - server? Move everything to Calibre on MinixNote-taking - Google Keep for now - any self-hosted service would need sync and multi-platform capabilities - simpler than TiddlyWiki? SimpleNote?Master account/service document with user ID and login (start w/ Firefox passwords?) (TagSpaces?)Backups - one local, one remote - drive attached to Minix - for remote: Photos/videos - Google Photos* Documents - NextCloud on hosted solutionBlog - shift most everything to private? - other than genealogy and writing, it's just a diary - who the fuck cares enough to bother with it? - maybe keep it on Minix/Kirby? - maybe stays on Pi as well?Genealogy - [thedixons.net](http://thedixons.net/) - move off of github - Wiki w/ blog? (WikiTree + Kirby?) - worth making it hosted for ease of access if I'm not here any more - survivability/sustainability - need to get others involved. TagSpaces to organize local files.Writing - separate blog for writing projects? - WordPress? - something hosted - survivability involves just keeping the hosting bill paid. Domain can be registered 10 years out. TagSpaces?Investment portfolio - eventually will need to move everything into one Vanguard Admiral account, S&P or something like it. Anything else isn't sustainable after I'm gone.Feed/news reader - something simple Dixie would like? Probably keep MiniFlux on Pi for now until shareable/user-friendly solution is foundRead later - TagSpaces?
