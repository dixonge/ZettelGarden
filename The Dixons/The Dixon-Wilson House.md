Dixon-Wilson house, Delaware

Another son of [William Dixon](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Dixon-357) and [Ann Gregg Dixon Houghton](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Gregg-34) was [John Dixon](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Dixon-350). John’s brother [Henry Dixon](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Dixon-348) built the [Dixon-Jackson House](https://thedixons.net/dixon-jackson-house/). John built a home around 1732 west of Henry’s home. This home, now known as the [Dixon-Wilson House](http://mchhistory.blogspot.com/2011/06/dixon-wilson-house.html), is on Valley Road southwest of Henry’s house.

The home has a datestone inscribed “I & J Dixon – 1732” – The ‘I’ most likely being John’s son, [Isaac Dixon](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Dixon-1159), and the 'J' probably being Isaac's older brother, [John](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Dixon-1156). When John died in 1740 John II inherited and lived in the home. When he died in 1766, his son, [John III](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Dixon-9439) inherited it. When this John died it was inherited by his son, [Isaac](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Dixon-9441). Yes, they liked repeating familial names! Finally, when this Isaac died the house was inherited by his oldest son, [Jesher](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Dixon-9443). In 1832 Jesher sold the home to the Wilsons, a fellow Quaker family with long ties to the area, and built his own house on Southwood Road, which is also still standing. I will write about that house in a future post…

Here is a partial family tree of the Dixons who lived here, beginning with the last Dixon owner, Jesher (John, the builder, not included)
