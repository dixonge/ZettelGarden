Samuel P Dixon house, Delaware

In 1791 [Jehu Dixon](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Dixon-1163), son of [Isaac Dixon](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Dixon-1159), built a fieldstone house in the eastern part of Mill Creek Hundred. After his death it eventually went to his son, [Samuel P. Dixon](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Dixon-1164) who lived there until his death in 1879. He expanded the home and added a fieldstone barn and a springhouse.
