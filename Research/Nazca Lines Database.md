# Nazca Lines Database

![[nazca-lines-on-google-earth.jpg]]

Google Earth was introduced in 2005 and for the first time in human history the average person suddenly had access to the kind of satellite observation technology that had been restricted to NASA and government security agencies. Since then millions of people have used the software to study the surface of Planet Earth. A favourite subject has been the mysterious and enigmatic Nazca Lines of Peru. Largely located in the arid desert of the Pampas de Jumana between the towns of Nazca and Palpa these huge geoglyphs have intrigued scientists and archaeologists since they were discovered by the American anthropologist, Alfred Kroeber in 1926. As they are really only visible from a few hundred metres above the desert plateau their origin and purpose has puzzled investigators for decades. Theories about the lines and geoglyphs have ranged from extra-terrestrial runways to water-sourcing religious ceremonies. Unfortunately they have been hard to spot. To assist Google Earth travellers, and to correct many incorrect maps, Aquiziam has compiled the most accurate and complete list of Lines and geoglyphs including interactive Google Maps and precise Google Earth ‘latitude and longitude’ co-ordinates.

THE ABOVE MAP IS INTERACTIVE AND MANY OF THE NAZCA & PALPA GEOGLYPHS ARE MARKED FOR YOU TO LOCATE. MAXIMUM ZOOM IS USUALLY REQUIRED TO SEE THE ITEMS CLEARLY. CLICK ON THE COLOURED MARKERS FOR MORE INFORMATION. ZOOM OUT TO SEE ALL LOCATIONS CURRENTLY IDENTIFIED. A FULL LIST OF GOOGLE EARTH CO-ORDINATES IS TABLED BELOW.

If you know of any meaningful Nazca geoglyphs that have been missed, please email us with the name of the figure and its location in Google Earth. The same applies to the co-ordinates for the Palpa Hummingbird, the Lobster, The Nazca Pelican, the Palpa Pelican (Egret) and the Palpa figure known as La Mujer. The lines and geoglyphs must be visible in either Google Earth or Google Maps. Any help is to keep improving this list is very much appreciated.

### Travellers Be Aware:

If taking a ‘package tour’ of the Nazca lines it is very important to make sure you know what you will be getting. Some people have been very disappointed with the high prices and short air trips over the geoglyphs. Local maps are often inaccurate and pilots have a habit of sometimes just making up names for the desert images.
