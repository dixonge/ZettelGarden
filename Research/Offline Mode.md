# Offline Mode

Need to rearrange things to get rid of dependence on a working, high-speed internet connection. 

Apps I use a lot and possible fixes or replacements:

- 1Password (does it require internet? Either way, is becoming PITA)
- Firefox (Brave has IPFS now?)
- Google Docs, Numbers, etc. (LibreOffice?)
    - Spreadsheets - Numbers works offline
    - Docs - Many options for text editing
- Notion (Anytype? Waiting for next opening)
- Recipe Keeper (works offline, but requires sync and would like a better option - maybe bread recipe app?)

Things I use Notion for:

- Relational Tables
    - Web Sites
    - ZettelKasten
    - To-read
    - Project/Task management
    - Tracking
- Writing projects
- Research notes
- References (bookmarks basically)
- File/document management/organization

Possible Notion alternatives

- Airtable?

    - Obsidian LYT/MOC modes?
