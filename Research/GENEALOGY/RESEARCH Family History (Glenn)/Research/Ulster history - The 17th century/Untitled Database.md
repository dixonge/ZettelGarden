    The flight of the earls was followed by an unsuccessful rebellion in 1608 by
Sir Cahir O'Doherty. Sir Niall O'Donnell and Sir Donnell O'Cahan were also accused
of treason and imprisoned in the Tower of London. This meant that almost all the
land in the six counties of Tyrconnell (Donegal), Coleraine, Fermanagh, Tyrone|
Armagh and Cavan could be confiscated by the crown, and therefore available for
plantation.

The plantation was to be carried out by ""undertakers"", who could only take Scottish
and English tenants, and servitors who were often ex-soldiers but could take Irish
tenants. About a quarter of the land was to be retained by the ""deserving"" Irish
who had not been implicated in the rebellions. County Coleraine was planted by
London companies (including Clothworkers, Drapers and Fishmongers) and was renamed
County Londonderry.

          - Sir Josias Bodley, in a report to James I, 1614.
          
      The population of Ireland in 1600 may not have been much more than 1 million.
The Ulster counties were the poorest in Ireland and had been devastated by nine
years of war. In the early years of the plantation, not enough settlers came to
fulfil the aims of the plantation, and there were complaints that the undertakers
were allowing Irish tenants live on their estates.
There seemed to be no reason to believe that this plantation would be any more
successful than any of the others carried out in Ireland. In fact, it was probably
the influx of Scottish immigrants later in the century, mainly moving to Antrim and
Down, which was to bring the strong Scottish traditions which persist in Ulster
to this day.
      In 1641, there was a major rebellion led by the Catholic gentry, who had
      lost most during the plantation. The accounts of the massacres of the
      settlers appear to be exaggerated, but certainly many men, women and children
      were killed, and others died from exposure and hunger. The following years
      were unsettled and extremely confused, with Civil War in England and the
      arrival of a Scottish army under General Monro at Carrickfergus in 1642.
      In 1649, Cromwell arrived in Ireland and took merciless revenge at Drogheda
      and Wexford for the Ulster massacres of 1641. In December, his army also
      defeated the settlers' army in Ulster.

          innocent blood"" - Oliver Cromwell.
          
      From about the middle of the century, there was a rise in exports of salt beef
from Ireland to the new colonies in the West Indies, from ports like Galway.
However, it was not until the 1680s that there was a marked improvement in
economic conditions in Ulster, when there was a further influx of immigrants and
capital. This was also the beginning of the rapid growth of Belfast, which became
the fourth most important port in Ireland by 1700.In 1688, Ulster once more became embroiled in conflict as a result of the
Glorious Revolution, when the Protestant William of Orange was invited to take
the English throne, replacing the Catholic James II.
Even before William accepted the crown in England, a group of apprentice boys
took matters into their own hands, shutting the gates of Londonderry to stop
the Earl of Antrim's Catholic troops entering the city.
The siege started in April 1689, when Jacobite troops blockaded the city to try
to starve the garrison into submission. After 105 days, following many deaths from
starvation and disease, the merchant ship Mountjoy broke the boom across the Foyle
to bring supplies to the city. The garrison at Enniskillen also refused to
surrender to the Jacobites, and won a notable victory at Newtownbutler.In June 1690, William III landed in Carrickfergus, and started to move his
army towards Dublin. He won a significant victory at the Battle of the Boyne|
although the Jacobites were able to retreat in good order towards Limerick.
A daring raid on the Williamite siege train frustrated attempts to take Limerick|
and William himself had to return to London. It was not until 1691, after heavy
Jacobite losses at the Battle of Aughrim, that Limerick finally surrendered.
After the Treaty of Limerick, many Irish soldiers, who later became known as the
""wild geese"", were allowed to sail away to fight for Louis XIV of France.
