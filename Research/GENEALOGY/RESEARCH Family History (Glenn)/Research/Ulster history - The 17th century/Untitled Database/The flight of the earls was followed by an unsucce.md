# The flight of the earls was followed by an unsuccessful rebellion in 1608 by
Sir Cahir O'Doherty. Sir Niall O'Donnell and Sir Donnell O'Cahan were also accused
of treason and imprisoned in the Tower of London. This meant that almost all the
land in the six counties of Tyrconnell (Donegal), Coleraine, Fermanagh, Tyrone,
Armagh and Cavan could be confiscated by the crown, and therefore available for
plantation.

The plantation was to be carried out by "undertakers", who could only take Scottish
and English tenants, and servitors who were often ex-soldiers but could take Irish
tenants. About a quarter of the land was to be retained by the "deserving" Irish
who had not been implicated in the rebellions. County Coleraine was planted by
London companies (including Clothworkers, Drapers and Fishmongers) and was renamed
County Londonderry.
