# In 1641, there was a major rebellion led by the Catholic gentry, who had
      lost most during the plantation. The accounts of the massacres of the
      settlers appear to be exaggerated, but certainly many men, women and children
      were killed, and others died from exposure and hunger. The following years
      were unsettled and extremely confused, with Civil War in England and the
      arrival of a Scottish army under General Monro at Carrickfergus in 1642.
      In 1649, Cromwell arrived in Ireland and took merciless revenge at Drogheda
      and Wexford for the Ulster massacres of 1641. In December, his army also
      defeated the settlers' army in Ulster.
