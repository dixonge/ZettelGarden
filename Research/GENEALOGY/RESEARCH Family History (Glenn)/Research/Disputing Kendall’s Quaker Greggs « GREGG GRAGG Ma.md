Forgive me if you have heard me say this before, but the recent series of messages regarding the early Gregg-MacGregor heritage force me to repeat it despite the fact that I am not an expert in this subject.

Hazel May Middleton Kendall, in her book *Quaker Greggs*, maintains that John Gregg, the first of the Gregg line which she documents in her book, was descended from the Glenstrae/Glenorchy, Argyll, Scotland, branch of the MacGregors of Clan Gregor.

She states:

> “Their leader, a John Gregg, evidently descended from next to the oldest son of Black John of the Coat-of-Mail…”

Kendall does not document the source for this statement and her use of the word “evidently” seems to express some degree of doubt.

She does document the line of chiefs of Clan Gregor based on “Memorials of Argleshire,” compiled in 1898 by Wm. Brown of Edinburgh. The last entry in this line, in Kendall’s book, is:

> “Black (Dubh) John of the Coat-of-Mail buried at Dysart in Glenorchy May 26, 1519.”

Dysart is the old name for the church and graveyard in Dalmally, Argyll, Scotland, at the head of Loch Awe and the entrances to Glen Strae and Glen Orchy. Dysart was an ancient burial ground for the MacGregors of Clan Gregor.

See my photographs of the Dalmally Church and graveyard at: [http://users.ev1.net/~rhuseth/MacGregor.htm](http://users.ev1.net/%7Erhuseth/MacGregor.htm) and the photographs of Kilchurn Castle, at the head of Loch Awe, which played a role in the Campbells take-over of the MacGregor homelands in Glenstrae and Glenorchy at: [http://users.ev1.net/~rhuseth/Kilchurn.htm](http://users.ev1.net/%7Erhuseth/Kilchurn.htm)

The booklet “Dalmally Church”, produced by the Dalmally Historical Association in 1991, under the heading “Some Dates in the History of the Church and Parish,” shows:

> “1498 Malcolm McGregour, son and heir of John Dow McGregour of Glenstrae, died at Glenlyon and was buried in Dysart on the 22nd of June. 1519 John Dow McGregour of Glenstray died on the 24th of May and was buried in a stone cist beside the high altar of Dysart.”

John C. Ward, in his Internet web site at: [http://www.ozemail.com.au/~wardjc/glencarn.htm](http://www.ozemail.com.au/%7Ewardjc/glencarn.htm), documents the “House of Glencarnoch (Glencarnig)” which includes the following entries:

> “Iain Dubh McPharie McGregor of Glenstrae the 6th chief. b c1440. d 24 May 1519…” and his son: “Malcolm the younger of Glenstrae. dsp Glenlyon 22 June 1498.”

**Note:** ‘Dubh’ or ‘Dow’ are Gaelic forms of ‘Black’ and ‘Iain’ is the Gaelic form of ‘John,’ so ‘Iain Dubh’ or ‘John Dow’ is equivalent to ‘Black John.’ There were many Iain Dubhs or Black Johns in different branches of Clan Gregor. At least one of them, but perhaps not John Gregg’s

possible ancestor, was known as “Black John of the Coat-of-Mail.” He may

have been referred to by the term ‘black’ because his coat-of-mail was

black (i.e., John of the Black Coat-of-Mail).

All of the above three sources mention a Black John MacGregor who died in

1519 and the last two mention his son Malcolm, who died before John in

1498.

Neither of the last two sources mention another son of Black John,

who was the ancestor of John Gregg according to Kendall.

A couple of years ago I had a series of e-mail discussions with Sheila

McGregor who, at the time, was associated with the Clan Gregor Centre in

Edinburgh. Sheila had extensively studied the MacGregors and Clan Gregor,

reading the old English, Gaelic and Latin records.

Sheila believed that

this line of MacGregors terminated in 1519 with the death of Black John

(his son Malcolm had died earlier). She indicates that the Black John who

died in 1519 was not the Black John of the Coat-of-Mail–that was the Black

John who died at the Battle of Glen Fruin in 1603.

Sheila further believed

that ‘Gregg’ was a surname used only by Lowland Scots and was never

associated with Highlanders to the best of her knowledge. She stated:

> “The short answer is that there is no known link between any Greggfamily (a name used by migrant members of Clan Gregor living inLowland Scotland, mainly from c. 1600 onwards but with a few earlier ones)and any of the Iain Dubhs of history. The Iain Dubh of Glenorchy d.1519 was the last of his line. And I believe the descendants of thisfamily have is not possible, and IMO never will be possible, toattach any Gregg family to a known Highland branch. I have looked at oneor two stories of this sort, and they seem to be wishful thinkingof the nineteenth century…appears to be a typical piece of inventiveancestor- hunting…I have never seen the name Gregg used in theHighlands. It is a Lowland name, always…from Aberdeen, Fife andAyrshire.”

Sheila stated that her beliefs were based on the following :

> “There are only a limited number of sources of information about earlyMacGregors, and I have as good or better access to them than Kendall (whois quoting someone at second hand, I think) or John Ward, who has justcopied the same stuff again and is uncritical at best. Most of thisinformation is taken from the Chronicle of Fortingall (CF). I have theHistory of the Clan Gregor by Amelia Murray MacGregor, which has oneversion of CF in it. I also have the 1830 edition of CF by Donald Gregory,which is different in detail, but the early people are much the same. ThenI have the Black Book of Taymouth, 1855 edition, which has a third versionof CF, continued to 1579, but again the early entries are quite accuratecopies. Finally I have a different English version in the Book ofFortingall by Duncan Campbell which has provided one or two more scraps ofinformation. The original is in Latin and I stick to it as far aspossible. So I have this Chronicle in three different Latin versions andthree different English versions. I also have at least two editions, inGaelic and in English, of the MacGregor poems from the Book of the Dean ofLismore and have studied these with considerable care regarding theearliest generations mentioned, both in Gaelic and in English.”

If John Gregg was really born about 1576, as Kendall claims, then his

father would have been born in the 1550s and his grandfather would have

been born in the 1520s. However, Kendall states that Black John was buried

at Dalmally in 1519. Therefore, there would have to have been at least two

generations between Black John and John Gregg.

Note that Kendall says

“descended from the next to the oldest son of Black John,” not “the son of

the next to the oldest son.”

Again, Sheila McGregor adamantly maintains

that the Glenstrae/Glenorchy line of MacGregors died out in 1519 with Iain

Dubh (“Black John”). She stated:

> “Relying on the Chronicle of Fortingall (which Sheila maintains is the bestsource of information and which she has read in three Latin versions andthree English versions) and later Campbell claims to Glenstrae, there isnot much doubt that John d. 1519 was the last of his line. He wassucceeded in Glenstrae by a member of Clan Dougalciar, the Balquidderfamily, John MacEwen VcAllaster. He was sued by John’s widow for somerents she thought she was entitle to as her widow’s portion. John MacEwenwas not of the same blood. The Chronicle says he had the same name, notthe same blood. Nowhere is any direct link given … Sir Duncan Campbell in1626 wrote out a rather dubious pedigree of the later family (from JohnMacEwen) to justify his purchase of Glenstrae, and if he could have takenit back beyond John MacEwen to Iain Dubh, he would have done so, certainly,since Iain Dubh had a better title as one of the older line. But he had toclaim it from a descendant of John MacEwen who was not ‘righteousheir.’ He was the legal heir all the same and I have not the slightestdoubt that everyone in the Highlands knew that the old line died out in1519 … I do not know of any such stories circulating among Greggs inScotland, and would therefore conclude that they were invented or devisedin America. One can never prove a negative, of course, and some inherentlyimprobable things do turn out to be true, but if nothing else, the lapse oftime between John d.1519 and the first Greggs in Scotland, which is morethan a century, with the added break of a move from Highland culture toLowland culture, makes survival of a known link in one particular familyvery difficult to contemplate…Of course the Greggs were MacGregors, andtaken from leading families, but not before 1611.”

Thus Sheila MacGregor does not dispute the fact that the Greggs descended

from the MacGregors of the Highlands of Scotland, but only questions that

this descendance was from a particular line of MacGregors (e.g., the

Glenstrae branch).

Perhaps we should remember what A.S. Gregg said in his introduction to

Kendall’s book:

> “In the collection of reliable data concerning the events of thedistant past, the law of diminishing returns appears to operate. Thefurther we are removed in time from the events to be recorded, thedifficulties increase, like gravity, as the square of the distance fromthe source.”

Thus the Greggs may or may not be directly descended from the MacGregors of

Glenorchy and Glenstrae, but the “Quaker Greggs” have an interesting

history in and of themselves. As Sheila McGregor stated to me:

> “Most of us have less history than the Greggs. At least theGreggs know who they are, in general terms.”

By the way, Sheila also doubted Kendall’s story about the “Gregg Cane”

being given to John Gregg by King James I/VI for services

rendered. However, I will leave that to another message if anyone is

interested.

# The Gregg Cane

**From:** Thomas Anderson

**Subject:** RE: Quaker Greggs “The cane”

**Date:** Sat, 3 Mar 2001 13:50:22 -0700

This discussion was on the list last year, and we had some wonderful
information from Richard Huseth which I had saved. I don’t think he will
mind if it is shared with the group once again.

Note that he also mentioned the ship Caledonia which supposedly brought Wm.
Gregg to the USA, but has anyone found proof?
Several have said no Gregg names appeared on that ship’s log.

—–Original Message—–

**From:** Richard Huseth

**Sent:** January 09, 2000 2:23 PM

**Subject:** The Gregg Cane. etc.

Two people asked me to post some thoughts on the Gregg Cane, so here goes.

As you know, Hazel May Middleton Kendall, in her book “Quaker Greggs,”
writes (page 16):

> “Previous to the reign of Mary Stuart’s son James I, 16031625 (known also
as James VI of England) a curious rumor floated that a Scottish King would
sympathize with Ireland because the Irish were the original ‘Scots.’ James
I established circuits and a complete system of shires in northern
Ireland. The English system was violently substituted. He had a mania for
colonization. Thousands left Scotland for Nova Scotia and Ulster [in
Ireland]. King James visited Scotland for the second time in 1617 after
which whole communities of various clans were transplanted to
Ulster. Among them were many Gregs from the clan Gregor. Their leader, a
John Gregg, evidently descended from next to the oldest son of Black John
of the Coat of Mail, received from King James I a silver-studded
ivory-headed cane in esteem and appreciation of his influence and
responsibility in the removal of the Gregs from Scotland to County Antrim,
Ulster, about 1618.”

I asked Sheila McGregor to comment on this story. As I noted in my
previous message, Sheila, at that time, was associated with the Clan Gregor
Centre in Edinburgh and appeared to be an expert in Scottish history (in
general) and the MacGregors of Clan Gregor (in particular). I think that
anyone who has read eight versions (three in Latin, two in Gaelic, and
three in English) of the 16th century “Chronicles of Fortingall” probably
qualifies as an expert witness.

Sheila wrote:

> “I suspect Kendall of putting 2 and 2 together and making more than 4 out
of it. James VI was in no mood to reward Greggs or Gregors for doing
anything in 1618. He was still breathing fire and brimstone over this
cursed clan, banning its name, enforcing worse and worse sanctions in an
attempt to extirpate them root and branch, as one of his Acts puts it. If
this is true, there ought to be some historical evidence to support it.The [existence of the] cane is of course a fact. I have perhaps not given
it enough weight. I also suspect some of the Clan were transported to
Ireland, to work as slaves, before 1611, but this would be very different
from the traditional story. There is IMO not the slightest chance of James
VI looking on any member of this family with the slightest warmth, unless
they were bringing him a bag of MacGregor heads. The going rate for them
was half a crown, and if the head was of a more important person your own
might be saved. His dislike of us can only be described as pathological.”

I remind you that these are only the opinions of Sheila McGregor. There is
no proof that Sheila is correct. In fact, the only way to disprove
Kendall’s claim and the Gregg family oral history would be to find
documentation of the “true” origin of the cane, which seems very
unlikely. Therefore, those of you who wish to believe that the Gregg Cane
was a gift from King James I/VI can take comfort in the fact that Sheila’s
statements are only her personal beliefs. Those of you who may doubt story
of the origin of the Gregg Cane can be bolstered by the expertise and
beliefs of Sheila McGregor. I guess I will keep an open mind on the
subject–we will probably never know for sure.

Kendall then continues (page 16) her story of the Greggs in Ireland:

> “John Gregg was given and settled his people in the barony of Glenarm,
County Antrim, Ireland, on the northeast coast.”And then on page 17:“William Gregg, oldest son of John Gregg and a Presbyterian landholder, was
forced to leave his inheritance of Glenarm Barony on the coast of County
Antrim after May 1653.”

Perhaps I am reading more into these statements than Kendall intended, but
to me these statements imply that “John Gregg was given the barony of
Glenarm” and that his son William inherited it about 1644. Such a reward
would be far more valuable and noteworthy than a silver-studded
ivory-headed cane and, if so, there should be some other documentation of
this. The book *Civil War and Restoration in the Three Kingdoms* by Jane
H. Ohlmeyer documents the history of the MacDonnell family in Antrim and
Glenarm. Randal MacDonnell became the 1st Earl of Antrim in 1620. His
son, Randal (1609-1683), became the 2nd Earl of Antrim in 1636/7 on the
death of his father.

According to Ohlmeyer (page 32),

> “His legitimate
younger brother, Alexander, inherited the barony and castle of
Glenarm.”

This seems to imply that the first Randal MacDonnell had been
the baron of Glenarm prior to his death in 1636/7. There is no mention of
a John Gregg in connection with Glenarm in this book.

This is not definitive proof that John Gregg was not the baron of Glenarm,
but I tend to doubt that he held this title. He could, however, have
“…settled his people his people in the barony of Glenarm” on the estates
of the MacDonnells and his son William could have inherited that land, but
not the barony.

Re-reading Kendall, I find that she lists two sources for
the above information: *Presbyterian Church in Ireland Vol. 2* by J.S.
Reid, and *Wills of Ireland*. Has anyone attempted to find these
sources? Perhaps the answer can be found there.

Kendall gives the early Gregg genealogy as:

- **1.** John Gregg (Scotland, abt 1576 – Glenarm, Antrim, Ireland, abt
1644)
- **2.**William Gregg (Scotland, abt 1616 – Ardmore, Waterford,
Ireland, abt 1672)
    - **2.1** John Gregg (abt 1640 – abt 1724)
    - **2.2** William “The Immigrant Quaker” Gregg (Glenarm,
    Antrim, Ireland, abt
    1642 – Christiana Hundred, New Castle,
    Delaware, 1687)
        - **2.2.1** John Gregg (1668 – 1738)
        - **2.2.2** Ann Gregg Dixon (1670 – 1729)
        - **2.2.3** George Gregg (1674 – 1744)
        - **2.2.4** Richard Gregg (1676 – 1716)
    - **2.3** Richard Gregg (abt 1644 – abt 1741)

Kendall continues (page 17):

> “During the reign of Charles I (1625-1649) these Ulster Presbyterians were
rigorously treated and insulted. In 1642 a Scottish army under General
Robert Monro landed in Ulster to help the colonists rally. Coleraine,
Enniskillen, and Carrickfergus defied as they were strong for king and
covenant. There was an insurrection at Carrickfergus in May 1653.William Gregg, oldest son of John Gregg and a Presbyterian landholder, was
forced to leave his inheritance of Glenarm Barony on the coast of County
Antrim after May 1653…This oldest son William (born 1616, Scotland) left
by ship after May 1653 his Glenarm Barony in County Antrim with three
children, Richard, William born about 1643 and the oldest son
John. Probably there were daughters. With his family he settled on the
southwest shore of Waterford County, Ireland, at Ardmore where he died
about 1672.”

There is corroborating support for the existence of such a William Gregg
and his forced removal from Glenarm. Charles A. Hanna, in his book *The
Scotch-Irish or The Scot in North Britain, North Ireland, and North
America*, writes:

> By the decisive battle of Worcester in 1651, which compelled Charles the
Second to abandon the kingdom and seek safety on the continent, Cromwell’s
popularity and influence became almost unbounded.The news of this unexpected revolution reached Carrickfergus on the day on
which the members of the Presbytery appeared before the Commissioners. The
intelligence entirely disconcerted their plans, the power from which they
derived their authority being at an end. No other alternative remained
than to exhort the ministers to a peaceable conduct, and dismiss them to
their perishes without delay.The Commissioners in Dublin, however, having
cheerfully submitted to the new Council of State, and the commissions of
the subordinate courts having been renewed throughout the kingdom, the
original design of removing “all the popular Scotts” out of Ulster was
immediately resumed.A proclamation was published by “the Commissioners
for the settling and securing the Province of Ulster,” specifying the
conditions on which it was proposed to transplant the leading Presbyterians
in the counties of Down and Antrim to certain districts in Munster. This
proclamation was accompanied with a list of two hundred and sixty
persons–including all those who, by their known attachment to monarchical
and Presbyterian principles, and by their station and influence, were most
obnoxious to the reigning faction–who were required, with in a specified
time and under certain penalties, to embrace the terms now offered.Declaration by the Commissioners for the settling and securing the Province
of Ulster; dated at Carrickfergus, the 23d of May 1653.

A list of the names of such as are to remove according to the foregoing
Declaration:

> “County of Antrim… Glenarm Barony … William Greg …”

Kendall states:

> “As a devout adherent, William Gregg was a member of a colonial Friends
group which left southern Ireland after October 1682, possibly in the ship
“Caledonia” with William Hoge.”

Has anyone been able to find anything about the ship “Caledonia” or a
passenger list for any ship which includes William Gregg?

And, finally, Kendall writes:

> “He [William Gregg] had with him the silver-studded ivory-headed cane
inherited as the next to oldest son from his father. By this time, the
cane had become an heirloom whose story he recited many times to his
children just as it was the custom for his ancestors to retain a bard whose
duty was to sing the exploits of the Gregg ancestral line.”

Have you
played the party game where a person is given a statement and it is
verbally passed from player to player to see how it comes out at the end of
the line?

A while back I came across a web site which showed some interesting early
Gregg genealogy. No sources were given for this information so I contacted
the author. I was told that the source was another, also undocumented, web
site. Again I contacted the author and was directed to another web
site. At about the fourth such web site, I was directed back to the first
web site.

Remember that misinformation travels across the Internet just as
fast as correct information. And I may be contributing to it here.

The bottom line: enjoy Kendall’s book-I know I was thrilled when I first
discovered it-but do not assume that it is 100% correct, particularly in
the early years.

And, by the way, do not assume that the Thomas Gregg who
married Rebeckah Janney in 1762 was the son of Samuel Gregg and Ann
Robinson as stated by Kendall.

**Subject:** Fw: Facts concerning the Gregg cane

**Date:** Sun, 9 Jun 2002 14:49:54 -0400

First of all the cane is real, as it rests about six feet from the keyboard we are using, waiting to pass to the next generation. With apologies to my English teacher you will see we, when we refer to ourself.

Most of the history of the cane can be found in the book *The Quaker Gregg*“published in 1944 by Hazel May Middleton Kendall. However some mistakes appear in the book, back in early forties they did not have spell check and incorrect date alerts. In my immediate family pages some mistakes we will attribute to hitting the wrong key on the old typewriter.

The preface in the book by A.S. Gregg was my Grandfathers brothe, Uncle Alber”. My Grandfather Charles and Albert helped Mrs. Kendall with some of the research for the book, visiting Loudoun Co VA and going over the old Quaker records.

We have visited the area , sat in the present Quaker meeting house and walked by rows of Greggs in the cemetary at Goose creek , present day Lincoln VA. Also visited the farm Thomas Coulson Gregg sold when he came to Ohio in 1834. It is remarkable that a book could be published with so great a wealth of information for future generations. The cane just rides along as the purpose of the book was not the history of the cane, but of the family.

Will add some personal experiences with the cane as we remember. Grand father and Father showing the cane to hundreds of visitors as we have done in recent years. As result of these contacts we have met many nice Gregg cousins and developed lasting friendships. Many questions have been asked, such as do you have a ceremony for the passing of the cane?

May 28 1955 at 3 PM. my Father called and said ” come down we need your help” . We helped carry his 89 year old Father from the house where he had lived all but the first six months of his life. The cane quietly passed to next generation.

July 10 1986 , 7 AM. as we sat with my Sister Beulah, the cane quietly passed to next generation and we realized we were the older generation.

In the spring of 1866 Issachar Gregg moved his family to what is now known as Gregg road, as 7 generations have resided on the road, his son Charles was six months old.

In 1873 his Father Thomas Coulson came to make his home with the family. where he passed away in 1878. Thomas Coulson brought the cane to the Gregg homestead where it remained untill 1986. So the cane passed from Thomas C. to Issachar B. to Charles A. to Howard M and to Stanley C. without leaving the house. The house where my Father was born and where I was born. The house has been home to three generation at same time on several occasions.

Starting with Thomas C. , Issachar was veteran of war between the states and was in poor health, so son Charles married and made home there to take care of parents as was the custom before nursing homes. Second son Albert left the homestead to a 50 year work in education. After the parents passed away Charles and wife Alverda Armstrong Gregg made a home fo!
her parents till they passed away in 1920.

My Father married in 1918 and left home, but May 30 1922 his Mother died, so in spring of 1923 he returned to homestead to make a home for his Father. He and my Mother Lillie DeBolt Gregg, made a home for Charles for next 32 years.

Yours truly also arrived May 1923, so we were a part of three generation family and had daily contact with Grandfather who enjoyed visiting with friends and relatives and telling history of the cane. We left the homestead to attend college and served three years as Pilot in Army Air Corps during WWII As stated in the book Issachar and wife Abigail Gibson Gregg purchased the home that her grandfather had owned, my older brother Arthur purchased this home from our parents.

Also in the original Gibson tract an adjoining property ended up in my Mothers family . We purchased this property from my parents where my wife Wilma Leedy Gregg and I have made our home for over 55 years.

So let us take a journey. Pages refer to book *The Quaker Greggs* by Hazel Kendall.

1. Pg 16 John Gregg 1576-1644 received an Ivory Head Silver studded cane from King James VI also known as King James I of England when he visited Ireland in 1618. King James reigned 1603-1625, in 1611 he authorized 47 scholars to translate the Bible from Hebrew and Greek to English making the King James version as we know it at present time.
2. Pg 17 to William Gregg 1616-1672 the oldest son, decreed it should go to next to oldest son.
3. Pg 19 to William Gregg 1642-1687 the second son, brought cane to America, landed on East coast October 28 1682.
4. Pg 20 to George Gregg 1674-1744 the second son.
5. Pg 190 to Richard Gregg 1715-1754 the second son. Richard’s sons married out of the Quaker faith and were disowned by the Church. This may or may not have any bearing on why the cane went from Georges line to Johns line. As you read the book, some of the old Quakers were really strict in discipline. A generation missing here as Thomas was not born till after Richards death.
6. Pg 126 to Thomas Gregg 1761-1832 the oldest son. So we see Williams wishes were not carried out for unknown reasons. A family heirloom is not thrust upon someone who is not interested in genealogy, or when we are young and busy at work raising the family we do not have time to discuss history. Just my personal thoughts.
7. Pg 129 to Thomas Coulson Gregg 1794-1878 the fourth son.
8. Pg 131 Issachar B. Gregg 1832-1905 the second son. As we stated above the cane did not move.
9. Pg 132 Charles A. Gregg 1865-1955 the first son. Book published in 1944 has Charles with cane.
10. Howard M. Gregg 1897-1986 the first son
Stanley C. Gregg 1923- the second son and present proud possessor of family heirloom that has somehow survived 384 year journey. We have two sons , Michael D. Gregg and Randy D. Gregg and one grandson John Charles Gregg. We have the faith that the cane will pass to future generations of Greggs who will cherish the short time it is in their custody.

thrust upon someone who is not interested in genealogy, or when we are
young and busy at work raising the family we do not have time to discuss
history. Just my personal thoughts.”

I agree with Stanley’s history of the Gregg Cane according to Kendall, the
key elements of which are repeated above. At last someone has speculated
why the cane may have jumped from the line of George Gregg and his son
Richard to another Gregg line. The out-of faith marriage of Richard’s sons
seems like a reasonable explanation to me–perhaps Richard was really
peeved with his sons and wanted the heirloom to go to someone more
interested in the family’s Quaker heritage.

The question is —- who did it go to? Who owned the cane from 1754 when
Richard died until sometime after (perhaps long after) 1761 when Thomas was
born? Kendall does not tell us and we may never know for sure.

What interests me more is just what line of Greggs did this Thomas Gregg
belong to? Kendall claims that he belonged to the line descending from
John and Elizabeth Cooke Gregg via their son Thomas Gregg (who married
Dinah Harlan) and their son Thomas Gregg (who married Martha).

As I have said several times on this list, I disagree. I believe that the
son, Thomas, of Thomas and Dinah Harlan married Rebeckah Janney in Loudoun
County, Virginia, and that their son, Thomas, married Naomi Whiteacre.

Now
that most of the history of the Gregg Cane is known, I would like to see a
discussion of this gaggle of Thomas Greggs.

Is there anyone out there who agrees with me? If so, why? I believe that
I gave my reasons in one of my last messages regarding the cane.

# Wife of William “The Immigrant Quaker” Gregg

Good question, but probably another with no definitive answer. I have
reviewed the following sources which discuss William (“The Immigrant
Quaker”) Gregg or his children. None of them, unless I missed a reference,
mention the name of his wife.

- *Quaker Greggs* by Hazel May Middleton Kendall
- *Gregg* by Colonel Robert Arthur
- *Precious Blood, The William Gregg Family* by Franklin B. Buser
- *Greggs Westward*” by Robert Gregg and Mrs. R. Wesley Gregg
- *Delaware Quaker Records: Early Members of Northern New Castle
County* by Herbert Standing
- *Chester County, Pennsylvania with Genealogical and Biographical
Sketches* by J. Smith Futhey and Gilbert Cope
- *Genealogies of Pennsylvania Families Vol. 1* from the
Pennsylvania Genealogical Magazine
- *A History of the Original Settlements on the Delaware* by
Benjamin Ferris
- *Biographical and Genealogical History of the State of Delaware
Vol. 1* by J.M. Runk & Co.
- *History of Delaware, 1609-1888 Vol. II* by J. Thomas Scharf

The somewhat common belief that William’s wife was Ann Wilkinson probably
originates from a careless reading of *Immigration of Irish Quakers* by
Albert Myers. On page 319, Myers, talking about William Dixon, says that
he was married to Ann Gregg, daughter of William Gregg. Then in the
footnote on that page Myers gives more information about William Gregg and
notes that he was buried in 1687.

Further on in the footnote, Myers says,

> “One William Gregg of Toberhead Mtg., and Ann Wilkinson, of Antrim Mtg.,
County Antrim, were married at Antrim, 11 Mo. 5, 1702…”

This, clearly, must be a different William Gregg since the marriage occurred 15 years
after the death of “our” William.
