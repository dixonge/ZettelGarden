Subject: Rubottom/Dixon/Dunn -- Chatham Co, NC--Cane Creek and Napton Meetings
Date: Tue, 30 Dec 1997 21:35:37 -0600
Hi All,
I would like to communicate with anyone researching the Thomas and Phebe
Dixon Rubottom line or the Simon and Elizabeth Dunn Rubottom line from
Chatham/Moore Counties in North Carolina.  I wrote a Rubottom book four
years ago and am trying to do a revised version.  The Rubottoms, Dixons
and Dunns were included in the Cane Creek MM listings, but actually
attended a small meeting called Napton, or Tick Creek, or Dixon's
Meeting in the southern part of Chatham County.  The meeting is said to
have begun around the 1760s and probably did not survive into the
1800s.  It was never recognized as a monthly meeting and records did not
survive.  Many of the later family members became Baptists.
If anyone is researching these families, or knows anything more about
the Napton meeting, please e-mail me.
Thanks a bunch,
Danene Vincent
