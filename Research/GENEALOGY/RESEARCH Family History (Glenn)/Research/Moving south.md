The Dixons of the PA/DE area began fanning out in the mid-1700's. Some went to western Pennsylvania, a few to Virginia, and of course many stayed put. My ancestors moved with a large contingent of Quakers to the Cane Creek area of north-central North Carolina in Orange County. They set up house along Tick Creek and Tick ridge south of present-day Siler City. Several are buried in a small abandoned cemetery under a stand of tall trees near the former Napton meeting house. They stayed for over 50 years before moving on yet again.
