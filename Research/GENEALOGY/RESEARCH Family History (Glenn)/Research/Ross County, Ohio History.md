> Simon Ratcliff was married August 10, 1820, to Rachel, daughter of Samuel Dixon. She was
born July 17, 1804. After their marriage they located on a piece of land in Eagle township, but
three years later removed to a farm in Vinton county, then three years later, to section fourteen
in Liberty township, where They lived fourteen years. Mr. Ratcliff then removed to
Londonderry where he engaged in merchandising for some twenty years, superintending his
farm at the same time. He then retired to his farm, of nearly seven hundred acres, and there
ended his days in the elegant country home which he had erected. He had a family of eleven
children: Harriet, Ann, Ruth, Emma, Rachel W., Jane, Pearly, Jesse and Simon, and two who
died in infancy. Numerous descendants of this early established family still reside in Ross
county, and some have attained to positions of prominence in political life.Other early settlers of Liberty who were identified with the pioneer history, though not of the
first settlers, were: Jacob Peterman, Lemuel Kilburn, Joshua Jones, John W. Williamson,
Morris Humphrey, Thomas Corker, Joseph Dixon, Joseph Wilkins, Jacob Mace, Samuel G.
Griffin.
