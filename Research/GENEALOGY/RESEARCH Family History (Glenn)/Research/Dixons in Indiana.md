I am researching a family of Dixon's that were early pioneers of Southern Indiana. What I have found so far on line is that a Henry Dixon seems to have come from Virginia where he was born in about 1775 and lived for a time in Kentucky (Virginia & Kentucky were of course at one time the same place)Henry & his wife Alcie Wilson seem to have arrived in Indiana between 1811 and 1815. The line I connect with is that of Henry & Alcie's son Ellison Dixon born about 1809 in Kentucky and died in 1881 in Jennings County, Indiana. He is buried in the Cave/Dixon Cemetery near the tiny town of Paris, Indiana. This is an abandoned Cemetery but his gravestone is still standing.	ï¿½
