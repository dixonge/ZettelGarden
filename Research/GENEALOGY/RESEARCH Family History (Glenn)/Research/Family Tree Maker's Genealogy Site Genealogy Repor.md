## **Ancestors of Isabel Eileen Malin**

**1094.** **Henry** **Dixon,** born Abt. 1637 in Sego Parish, Co. Armagh, IRELAND[210](http://www.genealogy.com/users/c/h/i/Billy-R-Chitwood/GENE8-0072.html#ENDNOTE210); died Aft. 1680 in NEW CASTLE, DELAWARE[210](http://www.genealogy.com/users/c/h/i/Billy-R-Chitwood/GENE8-0072.html#ENDNOTE210). He married **1095. Elizabeth** **Rose** Abt. 1661 in ?IRELAND[210](http://www.genealogy.com/users/c/h/i/Billy-R-Chitwood/GENE8-0072.html#ENDNOTE210).

**1095.** **Elizabeth** **Rose,** born Abt. 1637; died Aft. 1688 in New Castle, Delaware.
Notes for Henry Dixon:
Henry Dixon was an innkeeper and his inn was located in New Castle, Delaware. Walter Garchow noted that Henry was censored by Lurgan MM (Co. Armagh, Ireland) for "walking disorderly" with Robert Thornbrough on 29 October 1676.
Most of the information on the Dixon family was the central point of a rather extensive FIDOnet conversation in 1993.

A.C. Myers, Immigartion of the Irish Quakers into Pennsylvania. Dixon Research Paper Date: Sat, 15 Jul 2000 17:51:39 EDT From: Dkmcever@aol.com
Greetings. I want to share what I've uncovered at the Quaker Library recently at Swarthmore College.
1. I found an old letter written by Albert Cook Myers himself (Quaker historian), who said that he could never find any documentation that Henry Dixon came to America.
2. I found a recent Dixon research paper in the family files at the library and have scanned it into this email message (it was not copyrighted). All descendants of John Mendenhall the Immigrant should take note of this, as both his sons (John Jr. and Aaron) married the daughters of Rose Dixon, wife of Thomas Pierson the Surveyor. The general consenus is that this Rose came from the Dixon family of the Lurgan MM in Northern Ireland.
Though no new ancestors are found, this is valuable research. The strength of Mr. Dixon's effort is that he relied heavily on primary sources, visiting Lurgan MM and researching the public records in Northern Ireland. Though his focus is on William Dixon, he works through many of the early Dixons in N. Ireland, and also discusses the general history of the period and the Lurgan MM, thus revealing the context in which our Henry Dixon lived. I found it to be very interesting reading.

The Dixsons of Lurgan, N. Ireland
-E.O. Dixon, December, 1996
Forward
Genealogy, the pursuit of knowledge about ones ancestors is a widely popular hobby today perhaps partly because of the success of the Afro-American epic "Roots". But this interest in ones antecedents has been with us for a very long time, witness the large numbers of genealogical books and publications on the library shelves.
My own interest in my family history began in early childhood, when Benjamin Franklin Dixon, my father's brother privately published (1932) "Our Book"l a collection of anecdotes and rememberances of his immediate family, along with a serious effort to trace backwards the roots of that family in all its many branches. Perhaps Ben Dixon's most notable accomplishment was to directly link our family to William and Ann Dixon, a Quaker couple who separately had emigrated from Ireland to William Penn's Pennsylvania in the 1680's.
Although William Dixon's life in America (and that of his succeeding generations) is well documented with primary data (wills, land records, Quaker meeting records, etc.) little is known of his earlier life across the Atlantic. In the many books published about the immigrant families of Pennsylvania (like the New Testament, published long after the fact) it is generally stated that William, a weaver by trade, came from the Lurgan Meeting of County Armagh, Ireland in 1688; that he was born in or about 1662, the son of Henry and Rose Dixson, who did or did not emigrate with him; that he had two sisters, Dinah and Rose who almost certainly did; and finally that he had married one Isabell Rea in County Armagh in 1683, who (it is speculated) must have soon died, leaving William free to marry Ann Gregg in
Pennsylvania (1690).
-2-
>From the descriptions of the marriage of William Dixson to Isabell Rea, as they appeared in publications both public and private (although varying in content and spelling) it was clear that someone had had an opportunity to review the records of the Lurgan Meeting a century or more ago. In an attempt
to confirm and extend this information a professional genealogist located in London was retained in
1990. The attempt was a failure, perhaps because it may have been a temptation for a cautious Englishman at that time to pretend that County Armagh did not exist. I decided, given an opportunity, to tackle the project myself.
Fortunately, after a trip to England in September, 1995 I was able to spend two days in Northern Ireland in a preliminary search of public records and a visit to the Lurgan meeting house. The initial results obtained were so promising that I returned for four days of focused effort in September, 1996.
This paper is an account of the information developed.

Georqe Fox and the Quakers2
George Fox (1624-1691), the son of Christopher, a weaver of Leicestershire was a visionary, mistic and healer who underwent a mistical experience when he was 22, and soon after began preaching. He gradually attracted numerous followers, and in1668 formally organized the Society of Friends. He visited and preached in Ireland in 1669.
Members of the Society of Friends (first called "Quakers" it was said, because they 'trembled' at the word of God) believed that they needed no spiritual intermediary, but rather were illuminated directly by the light of the Holy Spirit. The members refused to pay the mandatory tithes to the Church of England,
take an oath, or bear arms. In a nation which at that time was already an arena of competition, hatred, and war between Catholics and Protestants, the Quakers were often subjected to discrimination and persecution.
William Edmondson2, born in Little Musgrave in Westmoreland, was a carpenter who joined the army and fought at the battle of Worcester in 1651, the concluding battle between supporters of Charles II and Cromwell. Mustering out of the army, he decided to make his fortune as a trader in Ireland, where
he had a brother in the army of occupation to help him get his goods into the country.
Settling in Antrim, he soon disposed of his goods and returned to England for a new supply. There he heard a sermon by a Quaker preacher and was converted. In 1654, Edmondson relocated from Antrim to Lurgan, and in his house there set up the first regular Meeting of Friends in Ireland. The next year, after meeting with George Fox in England, he began preaching all over Ireland, and was jailed and persecuted
many times.

William Penn (1644-1718)2, son of a wealthy, upper class English family came to Ireland in 1666 to visit his father's estate in County Cork. There, he heard a Thomas Loe preach, and was converted - and went to prison with other Quakers, although he was offered special consideration as a courtier. Penn
returned to Ireland in the following years, and in 1682 first went to America to found Pennsylvania on a large grant of land from the Crown, as a haven for persecuted religious groups. Many of his English and Irish Quaker friends emigrated to Pennsylvania, including a group from the Lurgan Meeting in 1683
and another in 1688. Some of the Lurgan Quakers became prominent in the politics and administration of the new land - most prominent was James Logan (1674-1751) who was William Penn's personal representative in Pennsylvania for many years and who held several high positions in the governing councils of the teritory.
The Lurqan Meetinq3
For 40 years after its founding, the Lurgan Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends met in the homes of its members. Finally, in 1695 a campaign was begun to finance and construct a meeting house. The records of the meeting list 129 contributors to the building fund, including William Dixson who
pledged 4 shillings (twenty percent of the contributors pledged 3 sh. or less). The new building was formally opened in 1697, and has been used continuously for 300 years. Now, however, the building has been sold, and a new building is being constructed nearby which will be opened officially in May, 1997. Mr. Arther G. Chapman, a member of the congregation, has been writing a history of the Meeting of that 300 year period.
The records of the Lurgan Meeting are now available on microfilm in the Public Records Office of Northern Ireland. Minutes of the mens meetings exist from 1675 (but not for more than a century later for the womens meetings). Records of births, deaths, and wills also exist from that period, but clearly are incomplete. Copies exist of many marriage certificates and of the disownments of members. -5-
The Dixsons of Lurqan Meetinq3
Thomas Dixson
The first known record of a Dixson in Lurgan, County Armagh is not from the Lurgan Meeting records, but frQm an official tax roll. A Thomas Dixson is listed on the Hearth Money Roll of 1664(4). Thomas, however, is listed four times in the existing records of the Lurgan Meeting - in 1676 he witnessed a
marriage; the same year he is the subject of an inquiry (he being perfect) in the minutes of the mens meeting; the next year he is counseled concerning marriage problems; and finally in 1693, his wife dead and with a child he cannot provide for, he is offered charitable support for the child.
Antho. Dixson
Presumably the abbreviation "Antho." stands for Anthony, although the handwritten version looks so much like Tho. Dixson (Thomas) that one might wonder if they are the same person. Antho. Dixson appears only twice, as a witness at a wedding in 1671, and again in 1672 - both times with Will Dixson.
William Dixson
Over a 35 year span (1671-1706) William Dixson witnessed the marriages of 9 couples within the Lurgan Meeting. On ten other occasions his name appeared in the records, as he lived out his life and as his relationship to the community changed. In 1682, the Bullocks and the Harlands gave their bond
for the payment of 37 shillings 9 pence to William (two entries) presumably for services rendered; a year later, William and Isabell Rea announced their intentions of marriage to the mens meeting (4d.,2m.,1683), and after three months were married (certificate dated 4d.,Sm.,1683).
Apparently the life and times were not easy. In 1691, William obtained the loan of 50 shillings from the congregation; in 1695 he pledged 4sh. towards the cost of construction of a meeting house; a few months later, the meeting appeared to offer William some kind of support (poor copy); and finally, in 1704, William, now destitute (and presumably without family to care for him) was guaranteed a house, garden and cow by the congregation; twice more in that year William received monitary charity from legacies set
aside for the poor and administered by the congregation.
-6-
Isabell Rea Dixson
In addition to the records of her marriage to William, Isabell appeared twice more in the records of the Lurgan Meeting. In 1695 she witnessed the wedding of John Walker and Sarah Hoopes; in 1698 she
witnessed a marriage at another parish in County Armagh (from a PRONI index, unconfirmed by me); and she was listed in an undated will of Kathrine McGee as one of a number of inheritors of clothing and
personal effects. Perhaps significantly, when Kathrine died in 1704 and her estate was administered (records of mens meeting, d,12m,;1704) Isabell was not mentioned as among the inheritors - raising the
possibility that she had died before Kathrine. Interestingly, it was at that same mens meeting that William was judged destitute (without fami1y?) and guaranteed the support of the congregation.
The name "Rea" appears frequently in the early records of the Lurgan Meeting, but it is not possible to deduce a family structure from those records. Margaret Rea witnessed the marriage of Isabell and
William, and Ellinor and Mary Rea had witnessed earlier marriages.
Henry Dixson, Rose Dixson
The first reference to Henry Dixson was in 1676, when he was autioned by the mens meeting for "walking disorderly", a condition perhaps equivalent to our present charge of "driving while
intoxicated". In 1683, Henry not only witnessed the marriage of Isabell and William, but signed the register first of 34 guests. Rose signed next to last on the list. No other entry for Henry or Rose appears after this date, but Rose also had witnessed an earlier marriage in 1682. -7-
James Dixson
This Dixson appears on an undated list of 41 male members, probably prepared after 1700. James also witnessed marriages in 1701 and 1705. No other records exist that might tie him to Thomas (an early child?) or to Henry.
Other Records of the Lurqan Meeting
The copies of marriage certificates after 1670 appear to be quite complete, solely from the number and distribution recorded. Other records - births, deaths, wills, disownments, and letters of transfer
are obviously incomplete. All of these records were reviewed for the time period of interest, and no Dixson entries of any kind were found.
As in any organization, there were leaders in the Lurgan Meeting who did the work - who made up the committees, maintained the property, counselled the errant, and represented Lurgan at the annual
meetings in London and Dublin. From the scarcity of references to the Lurgan Dixsons, it appears that they did not fall into this category of leadership in the Meeting.
As, for example, did Valontine Hollingsworth, whose name appeared frequently in the minutes of the mens meeting. The records list the birth of his many children by his first wife, Anne; her death on
5d,2m,1671; his marriage to his second wife, Anne Calvert in 4m,1672 (witnessed by both William and Antho. Dixson); his assignment to speak to Henry Dixson about his walking disorderly; and finally, as he
prepared to emigrate to America in 1682, his receiving a certificate of transfer from the Meeting for himself and "for the rest that go with him". Later, in America, several of the Hollingsworth family
married descendents of the American William Dixson.

Interpretation
How can we reconcile our long held understanding that our American ancestor William Dixson emigrated from the Lurgan Meeting in 1688 after earlier marrying Isabell Rea, with this "new" more complete data which establishes that both William and Isabell were living out their lives in Lurgan# a decade or more later? Clearly, there were two William Dixsons.
Does any part of the records of the Lurgan Meeting apply to our ancestor William? The William whose birth date has been set (arbitrarily?) at "about 1662" to make him old enough to have married Isabell some 21 years later?
A study of the data indicates otherwise. William of Lurgan was witnessing marriages in the 1670s when our ancestor must have been a young child; and both William and Isabell were witnessing marriages in Lurgan in the 1690s when ancestor was well established with a family in America. Finally, to assume that it was our ancestor William who married Isabell would also require that he subsequently abandoned her -but there is no evidence in the minutes of the mens meetings of any marriage problems between Isabell and her husband William. It appears that if we are to tie our ancestor William to the Lurgan Meeting and to the family of Henry Dixson, the evidence must come from America. A new review of primary data in the Pennsylvania area should be instituted.
Speculation
A scenario can be constructed that interconnects the two Williams and the Lurgan Meeting which (although it is pure speculation) is consistent with the known facts. It is presented below:
-9 -
A Possible Scenario
abt. 1648 William Dixson the elder is born, the younger brother of Henry Dixson.
abt. 1665 William the younger is born, the son of Henry and Rose.
abt. 1667 Henry and family arrive in Lurgan.
1671 Will the elder (at age 23) witnesses a marriage.
1676 Henry is admonished for excessive drinking.
1682 Will the elder (age 34) is owed a substantial sum of money.
1683 Will the elder (age 35) marries Isabell Rea, who also may be older - no known children result. His brother and sister-in-law witness the ceremony.
abt. 1685 Henry dies.
1688 Will the younger (age 23), his sisters, and some say his mother emigrate to America.
1691 Will the elder (age 43) is already in financial trouble.
1695 Isabell Dixson witnesses a marriage.
abt. 1700 Isabell dies.
1704 Isabell, a beneficiary in Kathrine McGee's will, is not mentioned when the will is administered.
1704 At the same mens meeting, the congregation under- writes the rental of a house, garden and cow at 40 shillings/yr. for Will Dixson who is destitute (age 56 and without family). Twice more in this year, charity is distributed to Will.
1706 Will. Dixson witnesses another marriage.
-9a-
A Further Note
The chronological records show a surprising lack of activity of William Dixson within the Lurgan Meeting during the decade 1672-1682. Like the dog of Sherlock Holmes, it is the absence of barking which sometimes speaks loudest.
Although it is not the purpose of this paper to refer to data developed in America, it is instructive to examine the statement of a Thomas Pierson, surveyor, who after he had completed his apprenticeship came to America in 1676 "in company with Wm Dixson". This is the Thomas Pierson who returned to England in 1681, came back to America in 1683, became active in the Kennett Meeting along with the Harlans, Hollingsworths, Dixsons, and Greggs, was married in 1686; widowed in 1687, and married Rose Dixon in 1690.
The Pierson statement has been a problem for genealogists who were aware that our ancestor, the American William Dixson probably was to young to have made the voyage to America in 1676. On the other hand, it now is reasonable to assume that William the elder, then a young man in his 20s, did come to America in 1676 with Thomas Pierson - and after a few years (perhaps finding that single women were rare in the new world) returned to Lurgan to marry Isabell Rea and live out his life there.
NOTE FROM DAN McEVER
(Not part of E.O. Dixon's article),
E.O. Dixon has done a great service to Dixon descendants in the U.S. However, what he has described here (regarding this William Dixon coming to America with our Thomas Pierson) is unlikely. When you consider that Thomas Pierson left from the LONDON area (the "Downes") in 1676, and that our Dixson
family was clear over to the northwest in Northern Ireland, it seems unlikely that the Dixson reference in the Thomas Pierson document is to OUR Dixsons. Why would any Irish Quaker want to journey clear over to England first (the source of major persecution at that time), before coming to the New World?
The above theory as described by E.O. Dixon is appealing, but it is purely conjecture. It is indeed possible that a William Dixson from Lurgan MM in N. Ireland came to America, and later returned. But it is highly improbable that he traveled with Thomas Pierson from the London area. It's far more likely that our N. Ireland Dixsons met up with Thomas Pierson in Pennsylvania.
Having said that, I greatly appreciate the work of E.O. Dixon, who has made a serious contribution to researching the Dixon family. --Dan McEver
