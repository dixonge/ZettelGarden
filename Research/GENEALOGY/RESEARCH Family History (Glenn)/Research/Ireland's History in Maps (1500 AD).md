The independent nature of the Anglo-Irish lords and parliament, as well
as the Gaelic chieftains, were a problem for late 15th century England.
The power of local lords was the dominant political influence in Ireland,
and most of the country was under the rule of Gaelic or Gaelicized lords.
The real political clout in Ireland was in the hands of the Earls of
Kildare ever since the Ormonds backed the losing Lancastrian
side of England's War of Roses, and after the rebellion of the Desmonds
around 1468.
In 1494 king Henry VII sent Sir Edward Poyning to help bring the settlers
more into step and legislation was passed at Drogheda which restated
categorically the subordinate position of the Irish parliament to the
English parliament.
In 1534, Henry VIII tried to regain England's influence in Ireland. He took
all power away from the 'rebelling' Earls of Kildare, Norman-Irish noblemen
who had long controlled English interests in Ireland, and Henry set up
more direct control. In 1541, Henry succeeded in having Ireland's
Parliament declare him king of Ireland. He established English laws in
Ireland and tried, with little success, to introduce Protestantism in the
country. When Henry broke with the Catholic Church, he instigated the
Protestant Reformation which would eventually set the deeply Catholic
Irish on a collision course with the zealously Protestant English. What
followed was, at first, a gradual replacement of Anglo-Irish politicians,
landowners and clergy with those more 'sympathetic' to the Crown. In
1536-37 Irish monastic property was declared confiscate to the Crown and
the Anglicized Church of Ireland became the sole legal religion in the
lordship of Ireland. In 1553 to 1558, the plantation of English and
Scottish settlers began in counties Antrim, Monaghan, Limerick, and in
Queen's county. Plantations were soon started in portions of central
Kerry, eastern King's county, northest Down, western Waterford and
sections of counties Cork and Tipperary. The introduction of plantations
was to dominate Irish politics down to 1641.
