Jesse, Samuel and Joseph Dixon came from Chatham county, N. C., about 1803, and located in Liberty. They were extensive laud owners in the township and Jesse Dixon built a mill on Salt creek, which was put in operation about 1807. It was arranged for Loth sawing and grinding, and was operated by Dixon until his death, in 1825. The property passed into the hands of his sons, Abel and Joseph, who continued the milling business for many years.

Jacob Dixon had a distillery and carding machine on Salt creek in an early day;

Simon Ratcliff was married August 10, 1820, to Rachel, daughter of Samuel Dixon. She was born July 17, 1804. After their marriage they located on a piece of land in Eagle township, but three years later removed to a farm in Vinton county, then three years later, to section fourteen in Liberty township, where They lived fourteen years. Mr. Ratcliff then removed to Londonderry where he engaged in merchandising for some twenty years, superintending his farm at the same time. He then retired to his farm, of nearly seven hundred acres, and there ended his days in the elegant country home which he had erected. He had a family of eleven children: Harriet, Ann, Ruth, Emma, Rachel W., Jane, Pearly, Jesse and Simon, and two who died in infancy. Numerous descendants of this early established family still reside in Ross county, and some have attained to positions of prominence in political life.

His son, George Dixon, spent a long and useful life as a resident of the township, as did also his son Elias. A daughter, Nancy, married Jacob Calver, who located on section sixteen. George and Jonathan Dixon died on the land which they entered, and the numerous descendants of these early families are still prominent residents of the county, some of whom have been honored with important positions.
