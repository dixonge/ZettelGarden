THOMAS RUBOTTOM--A WELSH IMMIGRANT

Around 1763 a young Welshman is said to have arrived in a port on the Delaware River in America. That young man was Thomas Rubottom, the first of that name in a long line of families who can be found across the United States today. One source stated that he probably came to this country from an English port as a stow-a-way. 1 Another source stated that Thomas Rubottom was born in Wales, and came with his uncle to the colonies. 2 While his specific circumstances have not yet been confirmed, it is believed that for a time he settled in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-New Castle County, Delaware area. From there he joined the southern migration, which included the Society of Friends (Quakers), through the Shenandoah Valley into the North Carolina Colony. Thomas Rubottom settled in what was at that time Orange County, North Carolina, near where the town of Siler City in Chatham County is located today. 3 (No confirming evidence has been found to indicate that Thomas Rubottom was himself a Quaker; however, it is known for certain that his wife was Quaker. Some early Quaker records, however, have been lost or inadvertently destroyed. So the possibility exists that he, too, belonged to the Society of Friends.)

Thomas met and married Phebe Dixon, daughter of George and Ann (Chandler) Dixon. The Dixon and Chandler families were Quakers from Ireland. George Dixon's father was William Dixon, 4 son of Henry and Rose Dixon from County Armagh, Ireland. 5 The Dixons had migrated from Scotland to Ireland due to the religious persecutions in Scotland under the Scotch king. While in Ireland they had been members of the Lurgan Meeting of the Society of Friends. 6 At least a part of the Dixon family came to Delaware from northern Ireland in the 1680s. 7 One source stated that Henry Dixon was an innkeeper at New Castle, but it has been difficult to find any record substantiating the fact that either Henry or Rose Dixon ever came to Delaware. It does appear that three of their children, William, Dinah, and Rose, settled in New Castle County and were a part of the Newark Meeting of the Society of Friends. 8

William Dixon was born around 1662 in the Parish of Sego, County Armagh, Ireland. 9 On May 4, 1683, William was married to Isabelle Rea, also from Parish of Sego, County Armagh, Ireland. 10 Among those who signed the marriage certificate were Henry Dixon, Rose Dixon, Thomas Harlan, and Isabelle Logan. Isabelle (Rea) Dixon probably did not live to come to Delaware. 11 William Dixon married second to Ann Gregg, daughter of William Gregg, by about 1690. 12 The Greggs seem to have come from Ireland, but had a Scottish background. In 1685 William Gregg acquired a tract of 400 acres of land in Christiana Hundred, New Castle County13 in the area of Delaware that, in more recent times, has become the center of the du Pont powdermaking industry. 14

William Dixon attended Centre Meeting in Delaware following his marriage to Ann Gregg. 15 Several of their children seem to have moved west to Mill Creek Hundred and became the founding members of Hockessin Meeting. 16 William was a weaver by trade and settled on Red Clay Creek, in Christiana Hundred, New Castle County. 17 He made a will January 31, 1708, which was probated on September 20, 1708. He mentions his wife Ann, and appoints his brothers, Michael Harlan and John Gregg, administrators. 18 Following William Dixon's death in 1708, his widow Ann (Gregg) Dixon married John Houghton. The Houghtons had three daughters. 19

William and Ann (Gregg) Dixon's son George Dixon, was born in 1706 in New Castle. 20 He and his wife Ann (Chandler) Dixon, daughter of Swithin and Ann Chandler, 21 were the parents of at least five children: Enoch, Caleb, Phebe, Joshua, and George. 22 It is possible they had a sixth child named Dinah (b. 12- -1729 and d. 8-20-1743). Dinah was listed with the other five children in the Concord Monthly Meeting records, but their parents were not identified. 23 George and Ann (Chandler) Dixon with some of their children moved from Delaware to Orange County, North Carolina Colony around 1767. 24

The marriage record of Thomas and Phebe (Dixon) Rubottom has not been found, so it is not known if they married in Delaware or North Carolina. They were the parents of at least nine children: Simon, Ezekiel, and seven girls (names unknown).

[AUTHOR'S UPDATE: Three daughters have now been identified: Hannah McSwain Rubottom b. ca 1768 married ca 1801 to Samuel Dowd b. 02-Jun-1775; Leah Rubottom b. ca 1775 d. 1820's married to Charles White b. ca 1770 d. 1847-50; and Sarah "Sally" Rubottom b. ca 1790 married 09-Dec-1819 David Robinson. Hannah and her husband remained in Chatham County, NC all of their lives. Leah and her husband left Chatham County in 1814 and moved to Tennessee. It is believed that Leah's sister Sarah "Sally" migrated to Tennessee with them.]

Thomas and his brothers-in-law were active in the Regulator Movement prior to the beginning of the Revolutionary War. 25 This organization had petitioned the Governor to have more say in governing their own affairs, but their requests were ignored and their movement suppressed. In the book Chatham County, 1771-1791, by Hadley, Horton, and Stowd, the authors indicated that Thomas Rubottom served in Captain Joab Brooks' Company in the Chatham County Militia in 1772. 26 Two additional sources state that Thomas Rubottom served in the Revolutionary War as a surgeon. 27 No confirming evidence has been located.
