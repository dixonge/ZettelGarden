William Dixon, Rose Dixon and Dinah Dixon all came over to the new world in 1689. In that same year William of Orange landed on the coast of Ireland and proceeded to sweep the Jacobite forces almost into the Atlantic. As the inhabitants of Ireland prepared for war it should be no surprise that the pacifist Quakers decided they wanted no part of it and instead sailed to Penn's Colony. The Dixons landed in and settled in what is now northern Delaware but was then still part of what is now Pennsylvania. There are many Quaker meeting houses in this area and when I travelled there in 1998 I attempted to document the Dixon cemetery headstones. I began to fear I would run out of tape! This part of the country was home to one of the largest and earliest line of Dixon immigrations.
