Following harsh reconstruction, it was necessary for the local leaders to petition the State Governor & the US Government for the right to reincorporate and elect a town council andappoint men to serve as Justice of The Peace (local judges).  In thesepapers J R Ellis is recommended for appointment as Justice of the Peace for Burtown Dist. John Newton Nicholson, grandson of Lettie (Ellis)Sarratt, was recommended for Justice of the Peace for Byers Dist.-----Source:A Voice in the Wilderness - A History of Buffalo Baptist Church by Bobby Gilmer Moss. When the Broad River Baptist Association met on Aug 23, 1867 they adopted a project of compiling a history of all member churches. JR Ellis is listed as the representative to the Broad River Baptist Association representing Providence Baptist Church and was given the responsibility of gathering & writing the history of thatchurch and turn it into the Association.-----IS HIS NAME JOHN OR JAMES?At some point -- someone guessed that JR Ellis was James Rickman. It turns out his name is John Rickman. This writer had never found him listed as John but think we have pretty strong case that he was John. Strange -- but I never noticed that Mark Ellis had JOHN Rickman from thebeginning. When I checked his web file tonight - I was shocked to seeJohn. I was contacting each one who has JR listed and asking for a correction. Looks like we all followed Paul Sarrett -- that is all but Mark Ellis -- Kudos  MARK!Going on the "James" theory sort of blinded me. When I found John R in the 1880 census in the old River Twp - I assumed that John Robert Ellis was the son of James Ellis, Jr. (1730) & Margaret Hopper who had moved to Georgia. BIG MISTAKE. Now I have found John Robert Ellis 1808s/o James Ellis, Jr., in Gordon Co., GA living close to his son Loric.This means that the John R Ellis living in River Twp is someone else.Now as luck would have it, both James Jr & his brother Benjamin J hadsons born in 1808. As if this were not enough - they both named theirsons John Rickman. We know John was the father of William (1704) who was the father of James (1735). Lord knows who Rickman was.So when I began to examine the data as to who this John R Ellis who was living in Twp #1 in 1880  (born in 1808). Now the answer is so simple it makes me feel stupid. We know J R was running the Ferry House in1880. And where is the Ferry House --- Duha -- in the River Twp #1. Sothere is no doubt that this is him. Further proof is the fact that Passy (Sarratt) died in 1878. So he has a new wife - listedin the 1880census as Lowisa (Louisa).In the 1870 census for the River Twp #1, there are 7 Louisa's. Two ofthese are in the right age bracket Louisa Jolly & Louisa Hawkins. Louisa Jolly is black.  Louisa Hawkins (white) (FG #83) age 33 is a widowwith 5 children. The youngest, Nancy is 6 - which puts her about 16 in 1880 and probably married. Now are you ready for this - JR & Passy areonly 4 houses away FG #87. This means J R Ellis was exactly in thesameplace in the 1870 & 1880 census. Are you getting the drift?It does not take a genius to see that Passy dies, 2 years later (or less) J R marries the widow just up the road.  Now where else would oneexpect to find JR in 1880 but in River Twp #1 running the Ellis Ferryand Ferry House?In this same 1880 census living next to JR is Truman Webber (FG #88),great nephew of Absolome Ellis & Hanna Webber. Next we find BenjaminJ&Marry Ellis, JR's parents (FG #89). Folks this John R Ellis is our JREllis.Source: 1850 Census, Spartanburg District, SC, (M432_858, p 252, Ancestry.com Image #315, FG Household #2381) J R Ellis 42 SC, farmer; living with wife, Patsy (Passey Sarratt) Ellis 41 SC; and 3 children ?
