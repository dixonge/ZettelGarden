[Rae Davis](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Davis-65942) has proposed a merge between [Jacob Dixon (Dixon-1185)](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Dixon-1185) and [Jacob Dixon (Dixon-1089)](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Dixon-1089). [[Thank Rae for this](https://www.wikitree.com/index.php?title=Special:Thanks&action=thank&rc_id=103767506)] [Click here to compare the profiles side-by-side](https://www.wikitree.com/index.php?title=Special:MergePerson&user1_name=Dixon-1185&user2_name=Dixon-1089&action=compare).

Rae says Dixon-1185 and Dixon-1089 appear to represent the same person because:

```
Hi Glenn, 
These two came up in my suggestion list as both being pointed to the same FAG memorial. Since they seem to be the same person, could you merge them, especially since Dixon-1185 is an orphaned profile?
Thanks,
Rae

There may be important information in the biographies or sources, so please [compare the full profiles side-by-side](https://www.wikitree.com/index.php?title=Special:MergePerson&user1_name=Dixon-1185&user2_name=Dixon-1089&action=compare). If you then agree that they represent the same person, **[approve the merge](https://www.wikitree.com/index.php?title=Special:MergePerson&user1_name=Dixon-1185&user2_name=Dixon-1089&action=merge)**. If the merge is ready you can select which data to keep from which profile and then complete the merge. If you're prompted to merge parents during this process, please do so. If you click to approve the merge but don't complete it, your permission for others to do it will be recorded.

If the profiles represent different people, [reject the merge](https://www.wikitree.com/index.php?title=Special:MergePerson&user1_name=Dixon-1185&user2_name=Dixon-1089&action=reject).

If the profiles appear to match, but you would like to complete the merge later because there is so much conflicting information to resolve, [create an Unmerged Match](https://www.wikitree.com/index.php?title=Special:MergePerson&user1_name=Dixon-1185&user2_name=Dixon-1089&action=match).

Merging is essential for [collaboration on WikiTree](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Collaboration). Our community aims to have one profile for every ancestor, shared by all descendants.

If you don't have the time or interest in actively managing profiles on WikiTree [remove yourself from some profiles](https://www.wikitree.com/index.php?title=Special:TrustedListChanges&action=remove&object_email=). You can also [suspend your participation](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Help:Suspending_Your_Participation) or permanently [close your account](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Special:CloseAccount). For help, see [How to Use WikiTree](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Help:How_to_Use_WikiTree) or ask a question in our community's friendly [Genealogist-to-Genealogist (G2G) Forum](https://www.wikitree.com/g2g/).
