"After the Union of Crowns, the Stuart Kings of England fared little better than their Scottish ancestors. Charles I was beheaded by the English Parliament in 1649; his son Charles II was a weak and unambitious king who died in his bed; James II fled England fearing for his own life and abandoned his kingdom and throne. All in all, the Stuarts could well be called a most unsuccessful dynasty!"|,,
