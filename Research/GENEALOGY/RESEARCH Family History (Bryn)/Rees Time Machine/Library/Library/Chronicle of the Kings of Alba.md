# Chronicle of the Kings of Alba

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The **Chronicle of the Kings of Alba**, or **Scottish Chronicle**, is a short written chronicle of the [Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_of_Scots) of [Alba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alba), covering the period from the time of [Kenneth MacAlpin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_I_of_Scotland) (Cináed mac Ailpín) (d. 858) until the reign of [Kenneth II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_II_of_Scotland) (Cináed mac Maíl Coluim) (r. 971–995). [W.F. Skene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Forbes_Skene) called it the **Chronicle of the Kings of Scots**, and some have called it the **Older Scottish Chronicle**, but Chronicle of the Kings of Alba is emerging as the standard scholarly name.

The sole surviving version of the text comes from the [Poppleton Manuscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poppleton_Manuscript), now in the [Bibliothèque Nationale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblioth%C3%A8que_Nationale), [Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris,_France). It is the fourth of seven consecutive Scottish documents in the manuscript, the first six of which were probably put together in the early thirteenth century by the man who wrote [de Situ Albanie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Situ_Albanie). The Chronicle is a vital source for the period it covers, and, despite some later [Francization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francization), is very much written in [Hiberno-Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiberno-Latin), showing evidence of a scribe with some knowledge of contemporary [Middle Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Irish_language) [orthography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthography). The original text was without doubt written in [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland), probably in the early eleventh century, shortly after the reign of [Kenneth II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_II_of_Scotland), the last reign it relates.
