# Edward Irwin Biography

Edward was born in the 1700s in County Antrim, Ulster, Northern Ireland and died about 1748 in Chester County, Pennsylvania. Like his brothers he was a descendent of the Alexander X Laird of Drum, Scotland. Edward came to America in 1722 with his brothers and sisters and they first went to Mount Holly, New Jersey where they transferred from the Quaker (Friends) Meeting in Ireland to the Friends Meeting in Mount Holly. On November 23, 1727 he married **Sarah Woodward**, in Gloucester, New Jersey. Sarah was born in 1705 in Crosswicks, New Jersey the daughter of Anthony Woodward and Hannah Faulkes.The Woodwards were listed as Quakers and were some of the earliest settlers in New Jersey. Justice of the Peace Joseph Hugg performed the marriage of Edward and Sarah and it is recorded in New Jersey Marriages 1600-1800 Book. Edward, like his brothers had left the Friends Church.

Edward and Sarah were among the first settlers in West Natmeal Township, which is now Brandywine Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania. They arrived shortly after their marriage and at the time there were only 8,000 people in all of Chester County. A list of all those who settled there between 1720 and 1740 showed less than 40 families. It was not long before Brother George and his wife Jane joined them. Many of the names of these early settlers will appearin the history of the Irwins, (Robert Lockard, Ephraim Allen, Adam Guthrie, Mathew Robinson, and James Dunwoody).

The Brandywine Manor Presbyterian Church played an important role in the Irwin History. In 1735 Edward was officially a ruling elder in the Forks of the Brandywine Manor Presbyterian Church. In May 23, 1736 he served as a Commissioner from this church and was sent to the Presbytery to present a call to a Rev. Mr. Black. Rev. Black’s salary was to be 55 pounds in Pennsylvania currency. No records remain of the number of members of the Church when Mr. Black was pastor. At the close of the Revolutionary war, the roads were little more than bridle paths through the forest. Several church buildings have been built since 1735 and today the beautiful structure that was built in 1875 is the location that the Irwin Reunion is held each year. I, Betty Jo, was very fortunate to attend the 125th year of this reunion.
