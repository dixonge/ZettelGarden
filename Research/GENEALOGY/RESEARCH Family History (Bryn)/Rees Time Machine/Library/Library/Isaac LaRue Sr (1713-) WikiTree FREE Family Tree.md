## Biography

Isaac LaRue was born about 11 January 1713 in Hopewell Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey [[1]](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/LaRue-285) (Map: Latitude: N40.5704 / Longitude: W74.9171) and his parents were [Elizabeth Phoebe (Cresson)](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Cresson-30) and [Peter LaRue](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Larue-404) (1688-1783). His grandfather was Abraham LaRue.

In 1743 he moved to Orange County, Virginia and was recorded as entering the Lower Shenandoah Valley, where he settled at a place called Long Marsh. He established the Virginia family of the LaRue surname. [[1]](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/LaRue-285)

He seems to have been quite prosperous. Although he started out with a simple log cabin, by 1779 he owned a total of 40,730.5 acres in Kentucky alone - and about 300 more in Virginia.

During 1781-1783 he performed military service by supplying beef and bacon to the Continental Army.

Among the depositions taken to perpetuate testimony in regard to land titles, preserved in the office of the Clerk of the County Court of Hardin County, Kentucky, are six depositions of Squire Boone (brother and fellow-adventurer of the more celebrated Daniel Boone), all of which relate to lands patented by Isaac LaRue, Sr., or by members of his family.

In one of these depositions, which was given 13 Sep 1797, Squire Boone says that "in the year 1779 he was passing through this way" and saw the tract of 6,250 acres of land (below the mouth of the Beech Fork of Salt River) and "when he had opportunity, ordered it to be entered in the name of Isaac LaRue, Senr."

Another tract, of 3.335 acres, was entered for Isaac LaRue, Sr,, by direction of Boone, in the year 1783. [[2]](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/LaRue-285) He also kept large herds of horses and cattle.

Two months after his 82nd birthday, Isaac died in March 1795 and was buried at Old Buck Marsh Cemetery in Berryville, Frederick County, Virginia, USA. [[3]](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/LaRue-285) [[4]](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/LaRue-285) [[5]](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/LaRue-285)

### Research Notes

A death source is to confirm his correct death date ...

- --

The following 2 profiles should not be confused again ...

- **Isaac LaRue, Sr.** m: Phebe Carman; res: VA & KY
- [Isaac LaRue](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/LaRue-1053), m: 1743 PA to Rebecca VanSant.
- --

The ancestors of the southern LaRue family are said to be Abraham LaRue's sons ... Abraham (Jr.), Isaac and Jacob LaRue - the first and last of whom he states were "pioneers in Kentucky, where LaRue county commemorates their name". [[8]](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/LaRue-285)

If this be true, however, the date of their removal was considerably later than there given, as Isaac was still a minor and at the death of their father in 1747, all were residents of Hunterdon County, New Jersey.
