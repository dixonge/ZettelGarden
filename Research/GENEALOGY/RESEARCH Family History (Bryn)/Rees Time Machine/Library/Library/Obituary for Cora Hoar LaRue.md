# Obituary for Cora Hoar LaRue

Cora LaRue, daughter of William and Mary Hoar, was born in Cuba, Illinois July 15, 1877 and departed this life April 17, 1961 at the age of 83 years, 9 months and 2 days. She moved with her parents to a farm in Rooks County, where she grew to womanhood. She was united in marriage to Chas. Everett LaRue Sept 8, 1895. He preceded her in death Nov. 6, 1943. To this union were born six children. Melvin, who also preceded her in death during World War I; Carl of Mankato, Kansas; Leslie of Fort Collins, Colo.; Archie of Denver, Colo.; Estella Taylor, of Mankato, Kansas; and Thelma Butler, of Fort Collins, Colo. She also leaves 12 grandchildren, 24 great-grandchildren; and 2 great-great-grandchildren; one sister, Mary Allen, of Fort Worth, Texas; two brothers, Will Hoar of Osborne, Kansas, and Henry Hoar of St. Louis, Mo.

Everett and Cora first resided on her father's old homestead in the Ash Rock community for a number of years. In December, 1959 she was made a member of the Sons and Daughters of the Soddes, and of this pioneer honor she was justly proud. She moved with her husband to Woodston, Kansas where they operated a grocery business for several years. Later they moved to Ionia, Kansas where again they were engaged in the grocery business. Due to the failing health of her husband they retired and moved to Mankato, Kansas in the fall of 1942.

She was a member of the Ash Rock Congregational church, north of Woodston for many years. When she moved to Mankato, her membership was established with the Assembly of God church. Her entire life was spent in faithful work of her Lord. She was an active member serving with love and joy to the very end of her long and useful life. She served as Deaconess for many years. Her Christian influence will be far reaching and felt ofter with the marking of time.

Her loved ones were comforted when among her later treasures these lines were written by her feeble hand:

> *Let me not die before I've done for thee My earthly work, whatever it may be; Call me not hence with mission unfulfilled. Let me not leave my space of ground untilled; Impress this truth upon me that not one Can do the portion that I leave undone.*

Funeral services were held Thursday, April 20 at 1:30 p.m. at the Kramer Funeral Home in Mankato and at 3:30 at the Ash Rock church. Rev. Jack Dennisen and Rev. Byron Luckey were in charge of the services.
