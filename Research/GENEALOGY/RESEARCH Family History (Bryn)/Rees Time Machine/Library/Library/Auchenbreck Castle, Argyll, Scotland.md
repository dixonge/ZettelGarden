# Auchenbreck Castle

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

**Auchenbreck Castle;** (or **Auchinbreck**) is located on the [Cowal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowal) peninsula, in [Argyll and Bute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argyll_and_Bute), [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland). Its remains are situated in [Kilmodan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilmodan)parish, near the mouth of [Glendaruel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glendaruel), 9 kilometres (5.6 mi) north of [Tighnabruaich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tighnabruaich) on the Cowal peninsula. Little remains of the castle, other than a flat rectangular platform, around 35 by 18 metres (115 by 59 ft), between Auchenbreck farmhouse and the Auchenbreck Burn. This is partially bounded by a [revetment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revetment) wall up to 2.2 metres (7 ft 3 in) high.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auchenbreck_Castle#cite_note-inventory-1)

The castle was held by the [Campbells of Auchinbreck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_of_Auchinbreck), a branch of the [Clan Campbell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Campbell) descended from Duncan, a younger son of [Duncan Campbell, 1st Lord Campbell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Campbell,_1st_Lord_Campbell). He was granted lands near [Dunoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunoon) in 1435, and further lands in [Glassary](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kilmichael_Glassary&action=edit&redlink=1). By the 16th century, the family were known as "of Auchinbreck", and the castle appears on [Timothy Pont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Pont)'s map of the late 16th century.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auchenbreck_Castle#cite_note-inventory-1) Around 1703 the castle was purchased by [John Fullarton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fullarton), former minister of Kilmodan, and later [Bishop of Edinburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Edinburgh). Fullarton renamed the estate Greenhall, and was the last person to live in the castle. When the estate was sold in 1728, after Fullarton's death, it included a mansion which may have been built from the stones of the castle. The castle itself was in its current ruined state by 1870.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auchenbreck_Castle#cite_note-inventory-1)
