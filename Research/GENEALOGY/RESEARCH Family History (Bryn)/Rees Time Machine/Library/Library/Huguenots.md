# Huguenots

**Huguenots** ([/ˈhjuːɡənɒts/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English) [HEW-gə-nots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key), also [UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English): [/-noʊz/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English) [⁠nohz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key), French: [[yɡ(ə)no]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/French)) were a [religious group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_denomination) of [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_people) [Protestants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism).

Huguenots were French Protestants who held to the Reformed, or Calvinist, tradition of Protestantism. The term has its origin in [early-16th-century France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_France).[[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] It was frequently used in reference to those of the [Reformed Church of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformed_Church_of_France) from the time of the [Protestant Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformation). By contrast, the Protestant populations of eastern France, in [Alsace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alsace), [Moselle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moselle_(department)), and [Montbéliard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montb%C3%A9liard), were mainly [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germans) [Lutherans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutheranism).

In his Encyclopedia of Protestantism, Hans Hillerbrand said that, on the eve of the [St. Bartholomew's Day massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Bartholomew%27s_Day_massacre) in 1572, the Huguenot community made up as much as 10% of the French population. By 1600 it had declined to 7–8%, and was reduced further after the return of [severe persecution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Protestants)in 1685 under [Louis XIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France)'s [Edict of Fontainebleau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Fontainebleau).

The Huguenots are believed to have been concentrated among the population in the southern and western parts of the [Kingdom of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_France). As Huguenots gained influence and more openly displayed their faith, [Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Catholic_Church_in_France#Appearance_of_Lutheranism_and_Calvinism) hostility grew. A series of religious conflicts followed, known as the [French Wars of Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Wars_of_Religion), fought intermittently from 1562 to 1598. The Huguenots were led by [Jeanne d'Albret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanne_d%27Albret); her son, the future [Henry IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV_of_France) (who would later convert to Catholicism in order to become king); and the princes of Condé. The wars ended with the [Edict of Nantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Nantes), which granted the Huguenots substantial religious, political and military autonomy.

[Huguenot rebellions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenot_rebellions) in the 1620s resulted in the abolition of their political and military privileges. They retained the religious provisions of the Edict of Nantes until the rule of Louis XIV, who gradually increased persecution of Protestantism until he issued the [Edict of Fontainebleau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Fontainebleau) (1685). This ended legal recognition of [Protestantism in France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism_in_France) and the Huguenots were forced to either convert to Catholicism (possibly as [Nicodemites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicodemite)) or flee as refugees; they were subject to violent [dragonnades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonnades). Louis XIV claimed that the French Huguenot population was reduced from about 900,000 or 800,000 adherents to just 1,000 or 1,500. He exaggerated the decline, but the [dragonnades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonnades) were devastating for the French Protestant community.

The remaining Huguenots faced [continued persecution under Louis XV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Huguenots_under_Louis_XV). By the time of his death in 1774, [Calvinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism) had been nearly eliminated from France. Persecution of Protestants officially ended with the [Edict of Versailles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Versailles), signed by [Louis XVI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XVI_of_France) in 1787. Two years later, with the [Revolutionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution)[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen) of 1789, Protestants gained equal rights as citizens.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-Aston,_2000_pp_245-50-1)

## Etymology[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Huguenots&action=edit&section=1)]

![https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Huguenot_cross.svg/220px-Huguenot_cross.svg.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Huguenot_cross.svg/220px-Huguenot_cross.svg.png)

[Huguenot cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenot_cross)

A term used originally in derision, Huguenot has unclear origins. Various hypotheses have been promoted. The term may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician [Besançon Hugues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Besan%C3%A7on_Hugues) (died 1532) and the [religiously conflicted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformation_in_Switzerland) nature of [Swiss republicanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Modern_Switzerland) in his time. It used a derogatory [pun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pun) on the name Hugues by way of the [Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language) word Huisgenoten (literally housemates), referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German [Eidgenosse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidgenossenschaft) (Confederate in the sense of "a citizen of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-EB11-2)

[Geneva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva) was [John Calvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Calvin)'s adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement. In Geneva, Hugues, though [Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church), was a leader of the "Confederate Party", so called because it favoured independence from the [Duke of Savoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Savoy). It sought an [alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_alliance) between the city-state of Geneva and the [Swiss Confederation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Swiss_Confederacy). The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) who were involved in the [Amboise plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amboise_conspiracy) of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential and [zealously Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_League_(French)) [House of Guise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Guise). This action would have fostered relations with the Swiss.

O. I. A. Roche promoted this idea among historians. He wrote in his book, The Days of the Upright, A History of the Huguenots (1965), that "Huguenot" is:

> a combination of a Dutch and a German word. In the Dutch-speaking North of France, Bible students who gathered in each other's houses to study secretly were called Huis Genooten ("housemates") while on the Swiss and German borders they were termed Eid Genossen, or "oath fellows", that is, persons bound to each other by an oath. Gallicised into "Huguenot", often used deprecatingly, the word became, during two and a half centuries of terror and triumph, a badge of enduring honour and courage.

Some disagree with such double or triple non-French linguistic origins. Janet Gray argues that for the word to have spread into common use in France, it must have originated there in French. The "Hugues hypothesis" argues that the name was derived by association with [Hugues Capet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Capet), king of France,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-Gray-3) who reigned long before the Reformation. He was regarded by the Gallicians as a noble man who respected people's dignity and lives. Janet Gray and other supporters of the hypothesis suggest that the name huguenote would be roughly equivalent to little Hugos, or those who want Hugo.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-Gray-3)

In this last connection, the name could suggest the derogatory inference of superstitious worship; popular fancy held that Huguon, the gate of [King Hugo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_of_Italy), was haunted by the ghost of le roi Huguet(regarded by Roman Catholics as an infamous scoundrel) and other spirits. Instead of being in [Purgatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purgatory) after death, according to Catholic doctrine, they came back to harm the living at night.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-CathEnc_Huguenot-4)The prétendus réformés ("these supposedly 'reformed'") were said to gather at night at [Tours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tours), both for political purposes, and for prayer and singing [psalms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psalms).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-5) Reguier de la Plancha (d. 1560) in his De l'Estat de France offered the following account as to the origin of the name, as cited by The Cape Monthly:

> Reguier de la Plancha accounts for it [the name] as follows: "The name huguenand was given to those of the religion during the affair of Amboyse, and they were to retain it ever since. I'll say a word about it to settle the doubts of those who have strayed in seeking its origin. The superstition of our ancestors, to within twenty or thirty years thereabouts, was such that in almost all the towns in the kingdom they had a notion that certain spirits underwent their Purgatory in this world after death, and that they went about the town at night, striking and outraging many people whom they found in the streets. But the light of the Gospel has made them vanish, and teaches us that these spirits were street-strollers and ruffians. In Paris the spirit was called le moine bourré; at Orléans, le mulet odet; at Blois le loup garon; at Tours, le Roy Huguet; and so on in other places. Now, it happens that those whom they called Lutherans were at that time so narrowly watched during the day that they were forced to wait till night to assemble, for the purpose of praying God, for preaching and receiving the Holy Sacrament; so that although they did not frighten nor hurt anybody, the priests, through mockery, made them the successors of those spirits which roam the night; and thus that name being quite common in the mouth of the populace, to designate the evangelical huguenands in the country of Tourraine and Amboyse, it became in vogue after that enterprise."[6]

Some have suggested the name was derived, with similar intended scorn, from les guenon de Hus (the monkeys or apes of [Jan Hus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Hus)).[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-8) By 1911, there was still no consensus in the United States on this interpretation.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-9)

## Symbol[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Huguenots&action=edit&section=2)]

The Huguenot cross

The [Huguenot cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenot_cross) is the distinctive emblem of the Huguenots (croix huguenote). It is now an official symbol of the Église des Protestants réformés (French Protestant church). Huguenot descendants sometimes display this symbol as a sign of reconnaissance (recognition) between them.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-10) [[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-11)

The issue of demographic strength and geographical spread of the [Reformed tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism) in France has been covered in a variety of sources. Most of them agree that the Huguenot population reached as many as 10% of the total population, or roughly 2 million people, on the eve of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in 1572.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-ReferenceA-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-13)

The new teaching of [John Calvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Calvin) attracted sizeable portions of the [nobility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_nobility) and urban [bourgeoisie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeoisie). After John Calvin introduced the [Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformation) in France, the number of [French Protestants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism_in_France) steadily swelled to ten percent of the population, or roughly 1.8 million people, in the decade between 1560 and 1570.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-ReferenceA-12) During the same period there were some 1,400 Reformed churches operating in France.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-ReferenceA-12) Hans J. Hillerbrand, an expert on the subject, in his Encyclopedia of Protestantism: 4-volume Set claims the Huguenot community reached as much as 10% of the French population on the eve of the [St. Bartholomew's Day massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Bartholomew%27s_Day_massacre), declining to 7 to 8% by the end of the 16th century, and further after heavy persecution began once again with the [Revocation of the Edict of Nantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Fontainebleau) by [Louis XIV of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France) in 1685.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-ReferenceA-12)

Among the nobles, Calvinism peaked on the eve of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre. Since then it has been sharply decreasing as the Huguenots were no more tolerated by both the French royalty and the Catholic masses. By the end of the sixteenth century Huguenots constituted 7-8% of the whole population, or 1.2 million people. By the time Louis XIV revoked the [Edict of Nantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Nantes) in 1685, Huguenots accounted for 800,000 to 1 million people.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-ReferenceA-12)

Huguenots controlled sizeable areas in [southern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occitania) and western France. In addition, many areas, especially in the central part of the country, were also contested between the French Reformed and Catholic nobles. Demographically, there were some areas in which the whole populations had been Reformed. These included villages in and around the [Massif Central](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massif_Central), as well as the area around [Dordogne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dordogne), which used to be almost entirely Reformed too. John Calvin was a Frenchman and himself largely responsible for the introduction and spread of the Reformed tradition in France.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-14) He wrote in French, but unlike the [Protestant development in Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism_in_Germany), where [Lutheran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutheranism) writings were [widely distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press) and [could be read](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy) by the common man, it was not the case in France, where only nobles adopted the new faith and the folk remained Catholic.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-ReferenceA-12) This is true for many areas in the west and south controlled by the Huguenot nobility. Although relatively large portions of the peasant population became Reformed there, the people, altogether, still remained majority Catholic.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-ReferenceA-12)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-15)

Overall, Huguenot presence was heavily concentrated in the western and southern portions of the French kingdom, as nobles there secured practise of the new faith. These included [Languedoc-Roussillon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languedoc-Roussillon), [Gascony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gascony) and even a strip of land that stretched into the [Dauphiné](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dauphin%C3%A9). Huguenots lived on the Atlantic coast in [La Rochelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Rochelle), and also spread across provinces of [Normandy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy) and [Poitou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poitou). In the south, towns like [Castres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castres), [Montauban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montauban), [Montpellier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montpellier) and [Nimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimes) were Huguenot strongholds. In addition, a dense network of Protestant villages permeated the rural mountainous region of the [Cevennes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cevennes). Inhabited by [Camisards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camisard), it continues to be the backbone of [French Protestantism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism_in_France). Historians estimate that roughly 80% of all Huguenots lived in the western and southern areas of France.

Today, there are some Reformed communities around the world that still retain their Huguenot identity. In France, Calvinists in the [United Protestant Church of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Protestant_Church_of_France) and also some in the [Protestant Reformed Church of Alsace and Lorraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformed_Church_of_Alsace_and_Lorraine) consider themselves Huguenots. A rural Huguenot community in the [Cevennes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cevennes) that rebelled in 1702 is still being called [Camisards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camisard), especially in historical contexts. Huguenot exiles in the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom), the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa), [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia), and a number of other countries still retain their identity.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-17)

## Emigration and diaspora[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Huguenots&action=edit&section=4)]

The bulk of Huguenot émigrés relocated to Protestant states such as the [Dutch Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Republic), [England and Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales), Protestant-controlled [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland), the [Channel Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_Islands), [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland), [Denmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark), [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden), [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland), the [Electorate of Brandenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margraviate_of_Brandenburg) and [Electorate of the Palatinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_Palatinate) in the [Holy Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire), and the [Duchy of Prussia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Prussia). Some fled as refugees to the [Dutch Cape Colony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Cape_Colony) in [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa), the [Dutch East Indies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_Indies), the [Caribbean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean) colonies, and several of the [Dutch and English colonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies) in North America.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-Calvin-18) A few families went to [Orthodox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church) [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia) and Catholic [Quebec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec).

After centuries, most Huguenots have assimilated into the various societies and cultures where they settled. Remnant communities of [Camisards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camisard) in the [Cévennes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9vennes), most Reformed members of the [United Protestant Church of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Protestant_Church_of_France), French members of the largely German [Protestant Reformed Church of Alsace and Lorraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformed_Church_of_Alsace_and_Lorraine), and the Huguenot [diaspora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora) in England and [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Australian), all still retain their beliefs and Huguenot designation.

### **Origins[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Huguenots&action=edit&section=6)]**

in the

[massacre of Mérindol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9rindol_massacre)

in 1545

The availability of the Bible in [vernacular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular) languages was important to the spread of the Protestant movement and development of the Reformed church in France. The country had a long history of struggles with the papacy (see the [Avignon Papacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avignon_Papacy), for example) by the time the [Protestant Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformation) finally arrived. Around 1294, a French version of the Scriptures was prepared by the Roman Catholic priest, [Guyard des Moulins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyart_des_Moulins). A two-volume illustrated folio paraphrase version based on his manuscript, by Jean de Rély, was printed in Paris in 1487.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-21)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-22)

The first known translation of the Bible into one of France's regional languages, [Arpitan or Franco-Provençal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Proven%C3%A7al_language), had been prepared by the 12th-century pre-Protestant reformer [Peter Waldo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Waldo) (Pierre de Vaux).[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-23) The Waldensians became more militant, creating fortified areas, as in [Cabrières](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabri%C3%A8res-d%27Avignon), perhaps attacking an abbey.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-Lambert_389-24) They were suppressed by [Francis I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_I_of_France) in 1545 in the [Massacre of Mérindol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre_of_M%C3%A9rindol).[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-25)

Other predecessors of the Reformed church included the pro-reform and [Gallican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallicanism) Roman Catholics, such as [Jacques Lefevre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Lefevre) (c. 1455–1536). The Gallicans briefly achieved independence for the French church, on the principle that the religion of France could not be controlled by the Bishop of Rome, a foreign power.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-26) During the Protestant Reformation, Lefevre, a professor at the [University of Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Paris), published his French translation of the New Testament in 1523, followed by the whole Bible in the French language in 1530.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-27) [William Farel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Farel) was a student of Lefevre who went on to become a leader of the [Swiss Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformation_in_Switzerland), establishing a Protestant republican government in Geneva. Jean Cauvin ([John Calvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Calvin)), another student at the University of Paris, also converted to Protestantism. Long after the sect was suppressed by Francis I, the remaining French [Waldensians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldensians), then mostly in the [Luberon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luberon) region, sought to join Farel, Calvin and the Reformation, and [Olivétan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Robert_Oliv%C3%A9tan) published a French Bible for them. The French Confession of 1559 shows a decidedly [Calvinistic influence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism).[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-28)

Although usually Huguenots are lumped into one group, there were actually two types of Huguenots that emerged.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-29) Since the Huguenots had political and religious goals, it was commonplace to refer to the Calvinists as "Huguenots of religion" and those who opposed the monarchy as "Huguenots of the state", who were mostly nobles.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-30)

- The Huguenots of religion were influenced by John Calvin's works and established Calvinist synods. They were determined to end religious oppression.
- The Huguenots of the state opposed the monopoly of power the Guise family had and wanted to attack the authority of the crown. This group of Huguenots from southern France had frequent issues with the strict Calvinist tenets that are outlined in many of John Calvin's letters to the synods of the Languedoc.

### **Criticism and conflict with the Catholic Church[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Huguenots&action=edit&section=7)]**

*See also: [Criticism of the Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Catholic_Church)*

Like other religious reformers of the time, Huguenots felt that the Catholic Church needed a radical cleansing of its impurities, and that the Pope represented a worldly kingdom, which sat in mocking tyranny over the things of God, and was ultimately doomed. Rhetoric like this became fiercer as events unfolded, and eventually stirred up a reaction in the Catholic establishment.

Fanatically opposed to the Catholic Church, the Huguenots attacked priests, monks, nuns, monasticism, images, and church buildings. Most of the cities in which the Huguenots gained a hold saw [iconoclast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iconoclasm) [riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot) in which altars and images in churches, and sometimes the buildings themselves were torn down. Ancient relics and texts were destroyed; the bodies of saints exhumed and burned. The cities of Bourges, Montauban and Orléans saw substantial activity in this regard.

The Huguenots transformed themselves into a definitive political movement thereafter. Protestant preachers rallied a considerable army and a formidable cavalry, which came under the leadership of Admiral Gaspard de Coligny. Henry of Navarre and the House of Bourbon allied themselves to the Huguenots, adding wealth and territorial holdings to the Protestant strength, which at its height grew to sixty fortified cities, and posed a serious and continuous threat to the Catholic crown and Paris over the next three decades.

The Catholic Church in France and many of its members opposed the Huguenots. Some Huguenot preachers and congregants were attacked as they attempted to meet for worship.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-31) The height of this persecution was the [St. Bartholomew's Day massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Bartholomew%27s_Day_massacre) in August, 1572, when 5,000 to 30,000 were killed, although there were also underlying political reasons for this as well, as some of the Huguenots were nobles trying to establish separate centres of power in southern France. Retaliating against the French Catholics, the Huguenots had their own militia.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-32)

### **Reformation and growth[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Huguenots&action=edit&section=8)]**

Early in his reign, [Francis I (reign 1515–1547)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_I_of_France) persecuted the old, pre-Protestant movement of [Waldensians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldensians) in southeastern France. Francis initially protected the Huguenot dissidents from [Parlementary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parlement) measures seeking to exterminate them. After the 1534 [Affair of the Placards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affair_of_the_Placards),[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-33)[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-34) however, he distanced himself from Huguenots and their protection.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-35)

Huguenot numbers grew rapidly between 1555 and 1561, chiefly amongst nobles and city dwellers. During this time, their opponents first dubbed the Protestants Huguenots; but they called themselves reformés, or "Reformed". They organised their first national synod in 1558 in Paris.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-36)

By 1562, the estimated number of Huguenots peaked at approximately two million, concentrated mainly in the western, southern, and some central parts of France, compared to approximately sixteen million Catholics during the same period. Persecution diminished the number of Huguenots who remained in France.

### **Wars of religion[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Huguenots&action=edit&section=9)]**

*Main article: [French Wars of Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Wars_of_Religion)*

As the Huguenots gained influence and displayed their faith more openly, Roman Catholic hostility towards them grew, even though the French crown offered increasingly liberal [political concessions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concession_(politics)) and edicts of toleration.[[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)]

Following the accidental death of [Henry II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_II_of_France) in 1559, his son succeeded as King [Francis II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_II_of_France) along with his wife, the Queen Consort, also known as [Mary, Queen of Scots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary,_Queen_of_Scots). During the eighteen months of the reign of Francis II, Mary encouraged a policy of rounding up French Huguenots on charges of heresy and putting them in front of Catholic judges, and employing torture and burning as punishments for dissenters. Mary returned to Scotland a widow, in the summer of 1561.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-37)

In 1561, the Edict of Orléans declared an end to the persecution, and the [Edict of Saint-Germain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Saint-Germain) of January 1562 formally recognised the Huguenots for the first time. However, these measures disguised the growing tensions between Protestants and Catholics.[[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)]

### **Civil wars[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Huguenots&action=edit&section=10)]**

These tensions spurred eight civil wars, interrupted by periods of relative calm, between 1562 and 1598. With each break in peace, the Huguenots' trust in the Catholic throne diminished, and the violence became more severe, and Protestant demands became grander, until a lasting cessation of open hostility finally occurred in 1598. The wars gradually took on a dynastic character, developing into an extended feud between the Houses of [Bourbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Bourbon) and [Guise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Guise), both of which—in addition to holding rival religious views—staked a claim to the French throne. The crown, occupied by the [House of Valois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Valois), generally supported the Catholic side, but on occasion switched over to the Protestant cause when politically expedient.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-38)[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-39)

The [French Wars of Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Wars_of_Religion) began with the [Massacre of Vassy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre_of_Wassy) on 1 March 1562, when dozens[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-CathEnc_Huguenot-4) (some sources say hundreds[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-40)) of Huguenots were killed, and about 200 were wounded. It was in this year that some Huguenots destroyed the tomb and remains of Saint [Irenaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irenaeus) (d. 202), an early Church father and bishop who was a disciple of [Polycarp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycarp).[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-41) The [Michelade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelade) by Huguenotes against Catholics was later on 29 September 1567.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-42)

The

[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Bartholomew%27s_Day_massacre)

of French Protestants (1572). It was the climax of the

[French Wars of Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Wars_of_Religion)

, which were brought to an end by the

[Edict of Nantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Nantes)

(1598). In 1620, persecution was renewed and continued until the

[French Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution)

in 1789.

*Main article: [St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Bartholomew%27s_Day_Massacre)*

In what became known as the [St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Bartholomew%27s_Day_massacre) of 24 August – 3 October 1572, Catholics killed thousands of Huguenots in Paris and similar massacres took place in other towns in the following weeks. The main provincial towns and cities experiencing [massacres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_events_named_massacres) were [Aix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aix-en-Provence), [Bordeaux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bordeaux), [Bourges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourges), [Lyons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyons), [Meaux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaux), [Orléans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orl%C3%A9ans), [Rouen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rouen), [Toulouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toulouse), and [Troyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troyes).[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-43)

Although the exact number of fatalities throughout the country is not known, on 23–24 August, between 2,000[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-44) and 3,000[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-45)[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-46)[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-47) Protestants were killed in Paris and a further 3,000[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-48) to 7,000 more[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-49) in the French provinces. By 17 September, almost 25,000 Protestants had been massacred in Paris alone.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-Partner,_P._1999-50)[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-51)Beyond Paris, the killings continued until 3 October.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-Partner,_P._1999-50) An amnesty granted in 1573 pardoned the perpetrators.

### **Edict of Nantes[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Huguenots&action=edit&section=12)]**

, circa 1600

The pattern of warfare, followed by brief periods of peace, continued for nearly another quarter-century. The warfare was definitively quelled in 1598, when Henry of Navarre, having [succeeded to the French throne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_of_Henry_IV_of_France) as [Henry IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV_of_France), and having recanted Protestantism in favour of Roman Catholicism in order to obtain the French crown, issued the [Edict of Nantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Nantes). The Edict reaffirmed Roman Catholicism as the state religion of France, but granted the Protestants equality with Catholics under the throne and a degree of religious and political freedom within their domains. The Edict simultaneously protected Catholic interests by discouraging the founding of new Protestant churches in Catholic-controlled regions.[[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)]

With the proclamation of the Edict of Nantes, and the subsequent protection of Huguenot rights, pressures to leave France abated. However, enforcement of the Edict grew increasingly irregular over time, making life so intolerable that many fled the country. The Huguenot population of France dropped to 856,000 by the mid-1660s, of which a plurality lived in rural areas.[[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] The greatest concentrations of Huguenots at this time resided in the regions of [Guienne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guienne), Saintonge-[Aunis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aunis)[Angoumois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angoumois) and [Poitou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poitou).[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-52)

[Montpellier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montpellier) was among the most important of the 66 "villes de sûreté" (cities of protection/protected cities) that the Edict of 1598 granted to the Huguenots. The city's political institutions and the university were all handed over to the Huguenots. Tension with Paris led to a siege by the royal army in 1622. Peace terms called for the dismantling of the city's fortifications. A royal citadel was built and the university and consulate were taken over by the Catholic party. Even before the Edict of Alès (1629), Protestant rule was dead and the ville de sûreté was no more.[[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)]

of 300 Protestant families in November 1661

By 1620, the Huguenots were on the defensive, and the government increasingly applied pressure. A series of three small civil wars known as the [Huguenot rebellions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenot_rebellions) broke out, mainly in southwestern France, between 1621 and 1629 in which the Reformed areas revolted against royal authority. The uprising occurred a decade following the death of [Henry IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV_of_France), a Huguenot before converting to Roman Catholicism, who had protected Protestants through the [Edict of Nantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Nantes). His successor [Louis XIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIII_of_France), under the regency of his Italian Catholic mother [Marie de' Medici](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_de%27_Medici), was more intolerant of Protestantism. The Huguenots responded by establishing independent political and military structures, establishing diplomatic contacts with foreign powers, and openly revolting against central power. The rebellions were implacably suppressed by the French crown.[[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)]

### **Edict of Fontainebleau[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Huguenots&action=edit&section=13)]**

[Louis XIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France) gained the throne in 1643 and acted increasingly aggressively to force the Huguenots to convert. At first he sent [missionaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionary), backed by a fund to financially reward converts to Roman Catholicism. Then he imposed penalties, closed Huguenot schools and excluded them from favoured professions. Escalating, he instituted [dragonnades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonnades), which included the occupation and looting of Huguenot homes by military troops, in an effort to forcibly convert them. In 1685, he issued the [Edict of Fontainebleau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Fontainebleau), revoking the Edict of Nantes and declaring Protestantism illegal.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-53)

The revocation forbade Protestant services, required education of children as Catholics, and prohibited emigration. It proved disastrous to the Huguenots and costly for France. It precipitated civil bloodshed, ruined commerce, and resulted in the illegal flight from the country of hundreds of thousands of Protestants many of whom were intellectuals, doctors and business leaders whose skills were transferred to Britain as well as Holland, Prussia, South Africa and other places they fled to. 4,000 emigrated to the [Thirteen Colonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies), where they settled, especially in New York, the [Delaware River Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware_River_Valley) in Eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey,[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-Calvin-18) and Virginia. The English authorities welcomed the French refugees, providing money from both government and private agencies to aid their relocation. Those Huguenots who stayed in France were subsequently forcibly converted to Roman Catholicism and were called "new converts".[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-54)

After this, the Huguenots (with estimates ranging from 200,000 to 1,000,000[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-EB11-2)) fled to Protestant countries: England, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Norway, Denmark, and Prussia—whose Calvinist Great Elector [Frederick William](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_William,_Elector_of_Brandenburg) welcomed them to help rebuild his war-ravaged and underpopulated country. Following this exodus, Huguenots remained in large numbers in only one region of France: the rugged [Cévennes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9vennes) region in the south. There were also some Calvinists in the Alsace region, which then belonged to the [Holy Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire) of the German Nation. In the early 18th century, a regional group known as the [Camisards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camisard) (who were Huguenots of the mountainous [Massif Central](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massif_Central) region) rioted against the Catholic Church, burning churches and killing the clergy. It took French troops years to hunt down and destroy all the bands of Camisards, between 1702 and 1709.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-55)

By the 1760s Protestantism was no longer a favourite religion of the elite. By then, most Protestants were Cevennes peasants. It was still illegal, and, although the law was seldom enforced, it could be a threat or a nuisance to Protestants. Calvinists lived primarily in the [Midi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_France); about 200,000 Lutherans accompanied by some Calvinists lived in the newly acquired [Alsace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alsace), where the 1648 [Treaty of Westphalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia) effectively protected them.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-56)

Persecution of Protestants diminished in France after 1724, finally ending with the [Edict of Versailles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Versailles), commonly called the [Edict of Tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_toleration), signed by [Louis XVI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XVI_of_France) in 1787. Two years later, with the [Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1789](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen), Protestants gained equal rights as citizens.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-Aston,_2000_pp_245-50-1)

### **Right of return to France in the 19th and 20th centuries[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Huguenots&action=edit&section=15)]**

The government encouraged descendants of exiles to return, offering them French citizenship in a 15 December 1790 law:

> All persons born in a foreign country and descending in any degree of a French man or woman expatriated for religious reason are declared French nationals (naturels français) and will benefit from rights attached to that quality if they come back to France, establish their domicile there and take the civic oath.[57]

Article 4 of 26 June 1889 Nationality Law stated: "Descendants of families proscribed by the revocation of the Edict of Nantes will continue to benefit from the benefit of 15 December 1790 Law, but on the condition that a nominal decree should be issued for every petitioner. That decree will only produce its effects for the future."[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-58)

Foreign descendants of Huguenots lost the automatic right to French citizenship in 1945 (by force of the Ordonnance n° 45-2441 du 19 octobre 1945, which revoked the 1889 Nationality Law).[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-59) It states in article 3: "This application does not, however, affect the validity of past acts by the person or rights acquired by third parties on the basis of previous laws."[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-60)

### **Modern times[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Huguenots&action=edit&section=16)]**

In the 1920s and 1930s, members of the extreme-right [Action Française](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Fran%C3%A7aise) movement expressed strong animus against Huguenots and other [Protestants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism) in general, as well as against [Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews) and [Freemasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry). They were regarded as groups supporting the French Republic, which Action Française sought to overthrow.[[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)]

In [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II), Huguenots led by André Trocmé in the village of [Le Chambon-sur-Lignon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Chambon-sur-Lignon) in [Cévennes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9vennes) helped save many [Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews). They hid them in secret places or helped them get out of [Vichy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vichy)France. [André Trocmé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_and_Magda_Trocm%C3%A9) preached against discrimination as the [Nazis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism) were gaining power in neighbouring Germany and urged his Protestant Huguenot congregation to hide Jewish refugees from [the Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust).[[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)]

In the early 21st century, there were approximately one million Protestants in France, representing some 2% of its population.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-61) Most are concentrated in [Alsace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alsace) in northeast France and the [Cévennes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9vennes) mountain region in the south, who still regard themselves as Huguenots to this day.[[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] Surveys suggest that Protestantism has grown in recent years, though this is due primarily to the expansion of [evangelical Protestant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism) churches which particularly have adherents among immigrant groups that are generally considered distinct from the French Huguenot population.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-62)

A [diaspora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora) of [French Australians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Australians) still considers itself Huguenot, even after centuries of exile. Long integrated into Australian society, it is encouraged by the Huguenot Society of Australia to embrace and conserve its cultural heritage, aided by the Society's genealogical research services.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-63)

In the United States there are several Huguenot worship groups and societies. The Huguenot Society of America has headquarters in New York City and has a broad national membership. One of the most active Huguenot groups is in [Charleston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina), South Carolina. While many American Huguenot groups worship in borrowed churches, the congregation in Charleston has its own church. Although services are conducted largely in English, every year the church holds an Annual French Service, which is conducted entirely in French using an adaptation of the Liturgies of Neufchatel (1737) and Vallangin (1772). Typically the Annual French Service takes place on the first or second Sunday after Easter in commemoration of the signing of the Edict of Nantes.

## Exodus[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Huguenots&action=edit&section=17)]

Most French Huguenots were either unable or unwilling to emigrate to avoid forced conversion to Roman Catholicism. As a result, more than three-quarters of the Protestant population of 2 million converted, 1 million, and 500,000 fled in exodus.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-EB11-2)[[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify)]

The first Huguenots to leave France sought freedom from persecution in Switzerland and the Netherlands.[[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] A group of Huguenots was part of the French colonisers who arrived in Brazil in 1555 to found [France Antarctique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_Antarctique). A couple of ships with around 500 people arrived at the Guanabara Bay, present-day [Rio de Janeiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro), and settled on a small island. A fort, named [Fort Coligny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Coligny), was built to protect them from attack from the Portuguese troops and Brazilian natives. It was an attempt to establish a French colony in South America. The fort was destroyed in 1560 by the Portuguese, who captured some of the Huguenots. The Portuguese threatened their Protestant prisoners with death if they did not convert to Roman Catholicism. The Huguenots of Guanabara, as they are now known, produced what is known as the [Guanabara Confession of Faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanabara_Confession_of_Faith) to explain their beliefs. The Portuguese executed them.

### **South Africa[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Huguenots&action=edit&section=19)]**

*Main article: [Huguenots in South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots_in_South_Africa)*

Individual Huguenots settled at the [Cape of Good Hope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_of_Good_Hope) from as early as 1671; the first documented was the wagonmaker François Vilion ([Viljoen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viljoen)). The first Huguenot to arrive at the Cape of Good Hope was [Maria de la Quellerie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_van_Riebeeck), wife of commander [Jan van Riebeeck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_van_Riebeeck) (and daughter of a [Walloon church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walloon_church) minister), who arrived on 6 April 1652 to establish a settlement at what is today [Cape Town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town). The couple left for the [Batavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batavia,_Dutch_East_Indies) ten years later.

But it was not until 31 December 1687 that the first organised group of Huguenots set sail from the Netherlands to the [Dutch East India Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company) post at the Cape of Good Hope.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-FRC-7-64) The largest portion of the Huguenots to settle in the Cape arrived between 1688 and 1689 in seven ships as part of the organised migration, but quite a few arrived as late as 1700; thereafter, the numbers declined and only small groups arrived at a time.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-FRC-10-65)

in

[Western Cape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Cape)

province,

[South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa)

Many of these settlers were given land in an area that was later called [Franschhoek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franschhoek) ([Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language) for "French Corner"), in the present-day [Western Cape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Cape) province of South Africa. A large monument to commemorate the arrival of the Huguenots in South Africa was inaugurated on 7 April 1948 at Franschhoek. The Huguenot Memorial Museum was also erected there and opened in 1957.

The official policy of the [Dutch East India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company) governors was to integrate the Huguenot and the [Dutch communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Dutch). When Paul Roux, a pastor who arrived with the main group of Huguenots, died in 1724, the Dutch administration, as a special concession, permitted another French cleric to take his place "for the benefit of the elderly who spoke only French".[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-66) But with [assimilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_shift), within three generations the Huguenots had generally adopted Dutch as their first and home language.

Many of the farms in the Western Cape province in South Africa still bear French names. Many families, today, mostly [Afrikaans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaans)speaking, have surnames indicating their French Huguenot ancestry. Examples include: Blignaut, Cilliers, Cronje (Cronier), de Klerk (Le Clercq), [de Villiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Villiers), du Plessis, Du Preez (Des Pres), du Randt (Durand), du Toit, Duvenhage(Du Vinage), Franck, Fouché, Fourie (Fleurit), Gervais, Giliomee (Guilliaume), Gous/Gouws (Gauch), Hugo, Jordaan (Jourdan), [Joubert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joubert), Kriek, Labuschagne (la Buscagne), [le Roux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leroux_(surname)), Lombard, [Malan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malan_(disambiguation)), [Malherbe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malherbe_(surname)), Marais, Maree, Minnaar (Mesnard), Nel (Nell), Naudé, Nortjé (Nortier), [Pienaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pienaar) (Pinard), Retief (Retif), Rossouw ([Rousseau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rousseau_(surname))), Taljaard (Taillard), TerBlanche, Theron, [Viljoen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viljoen) (Vilion) and Visagie (Visage).[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-67)[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-68)The [wine industry in South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_wine) owes a significant debt to the Huguenots, some of whom had [vineyards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vineyard) in France, or were brandy distillers, and used their skills in their new home.

French Huguenots made two attempts to establish a haven in North America. In 1562, naval officer [Jean Ribault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Ribault) led an expedition that explored [Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida) and the present-day [Southeastern US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States), and founded the outpost of [Charlesfort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlesfort-Santa_Elena_Site) on [Parris Island, South Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parris_Island,_South_Carolina). The French Wars of Religion precluded a return voyage, and the outpost was abandoned. In 1564, Ribault's former lieutenant [René Goulaine de Laudonnière](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Goulaine_de_Laudonni%C3%A8re) launched a second voyage to build a colony; he established [Fort Caroline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Caroline) in what is now [Jacksonville, Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida). War at home again precluded a resupply mission, and the colony struggled. In 1565 the Spanish decided to enforce their claim to [La Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Florida), and sent [Pedro Menéndez de Avilés](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Men%C3%A9ndez_de_Avil%C3%A9s), who established the settlement of [St. Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Augustine,_Florida) near Fort Caroline. Menéndez' forces routed the French and executed most of the Protestant captives.

Barred by the government from settling in [New France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_France), Huguenots led by [Jessé de Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jess%C3%A9_de_Forest), sailed to North America in 1624 and settled instead in the Dutch colony of [New Netherland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Netherland) (later incorporated into New York and New Jersey); as well as Great Britain's colonies, including [Nova Scotia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia). A number of New Amsterdam's families were of Huguenot origin, often having immigrated as refugees to the Netherlands in the previous century. In 1628 the Huguenots established a congregation as L'Église française à la Nouvelle-Amsterdam (the French church in New Amsterdam). This parish continues today as L'Eglise du Saint-Esprit, now a part of the [Episcopal Church (United States)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episcopal_Church_(United_States)) (Anglican) communion, and welcomes Francophone New Yorkers from all over the world.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-69) Upon their arrival in New Amsterdam, Huguenots were offered land directly across from Manhattan on Long Island for a permanent settlement and chose the harbour at the end of [Newtown Creek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtown_Creek), becoming the first Europeans to live in [Brooklyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn), then known as Boschwick, in the neighbourhood now known as [Bushwick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushwick,_Brooklyn).

Huguenot immigrants did not disperse or settle in different parts of the country, but rather, formed three societies or congregations; one in the city of New York, another 21 miles north of New York in a town which they named [New Rochelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Rochelle,_New_York), and a third further upstate in [New Paltz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Paltz_(village),_New_York). The "[Huguenot Street Historic District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenot_Street_Historic_District)" in New Paltz has been designated a National Historic Landmark site and contains one of the oldest streets in the United States of America. A small group of Huguenots also settled on the [south shore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rossville,_Staten_Island) of [Staten Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staten_Island) along the [New York Harbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Harbor), for which the current neighbourhood of [Huguenot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenot,_Staten_Island) was named. Huguenot refugees also settled in the [Delaware River Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware_Valley) of Eastern Pennsylvania and Hunterdon County, New Jersey in 1725. [Frenchtown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenchtown,_New_Jersey) in New Jersey bears the mark of early settlers.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-Calvin-18)

[New Rochelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Rochelle,_New_York), located in the county of [Westchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westchester,_New_York) on the north shore of [Long Island Sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island_Sound), seemed to be the great location of the Huguenots in New York. It is said that they landed on the coastline peninsula of Davenports Neck called "Bauffet's Point" after travelling from England where they had previously taken refuge on account of religious persecution, four years before the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. They purchased from John Pell, Lord of [Pelham Manor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelham_Manor,_New_York), a tract of land consisting of six thousand one hundred acres with the help of [Jacob Leisler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Leisler). It was named New Rochelle after La Rochelle, their former strong-hold in France. A small wooden church was first erected in the community, followed by a second church that was built of stone. Previous to the erection of it, the strong men would often walk twenty-three miles on Saturday evening, the distance by the road from New Rochelle to New York, to attend the Sunday service. The church was eventually replaced by a third, [Trinity-St. Paul's Episcopal Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity-St._Paul%27s_Episcopal_Church_(New_Rochelle,_New_York)), which contains heirlooms including the original bell from the French Huguenot Church "Eglise du St. Esperit" on Pine Street in New York City, which is preserved as a relic in the tower room. The Huguenot cemetery, or the "Huguenot Burial Ground", has since been recognised as a historic cemetery that is the final resting place for a wide range of the Huguenot founders, early settlers and prominent citizens dating back more than three centuries.

Some Huguenot immigrants settled in central and eastern Pennsylvania. They assimilated with the predominantly [Pennsylvania German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Dutch) settlers of the area.

In 1700 several hundred French Huguenots migrated from England to the colony of [Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia), where the King [William III of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_III_of_England) had promised them land grants in [Lower Norfolk County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Norfolk_County,_Virginia).[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-70) When they arrived, colonial authorities offered them instead land 20 miles above the falls of the James River, at the abandoned [Monacan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monacan_Indian_Nation) village known as [Manakin Town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manakin-Sabot,_Virginia), now in [Goochland County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goochland_County,_Virginia). Some settlers landed in present-day [Chesterfield County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesterfield_County,_Virginia). On 12 May 1705, the [Virginia General Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_General_Assembly) passed an act to naturalise the 148 Huguenots still resident at Manakintown. Of the original 390 settlers in the isolated settlement, many had died; others lived outside town on farms in the English style; and others moved to different areas.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-71) Gradually they intermarried with their English neighbours. Through the 18th and 19th centuries, descendants of the French migrated west into the Piedmont, and across the [Appalachian Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains) into the West of what became Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, and other states. In the Manakintown area, the [Huguenot Memorial Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenot_Memorial_Bridge) across the [James River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_River) and Huguenot Road were named in their honour, as were many local features, including several schools, including [Huguenot High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenot_High_School).

[French Huguenot Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenot_Church)

in

[Charleston, South Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina)

In the early years, many Huguenots also settled in the area of present-day [Charleston, South Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina). In 1685, Rev. Elie Prioleau from the town of [Pons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pons,_Charente-Maritime) in France, was among the first to settle there. He became pastor of the first Huguenot church in North America in that city. After the Revocation of the [Edict of Nantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Nantes) in 1685, several Huguenots including [Edmund Bohun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Bohun) of Suffolk, England, [Pierre Bacot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Bacot) of Touraine France, [Jean Postell](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jean_Postell&action=edit&redlink=1) of Dieppe France, [Alexander Pepin](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexander_Pepin&action=edit&redlink=1), [Antoine Poitevin](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antoine_Poitevin&action=edit&redlink=1) of Orsement France, and [Jacques de Bordeaux](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jacques_de_Bordeaux&action=edit&redlink=1) of Grenoble, immigrated to the Charleston Orange district. They were very successful at marriage and property speculation. After petitioning the British Crown in 1697 for the right to own land in the Baronies, they prospered as slave owners on the Cooper, Ashepoo, Ashley and Santee River plantations they purchased from the British Landgrave [Edmund Bellinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edmund_Bellinger&action=edit&redlink=1). Some of their descendants moved into the Deep South and Texas, where they developed new plantations.

The French [Huguenot Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenot_Church) of Charleston, which remains independent, is the oldest continuously active Huguenot congregation in the United States. L'Eglise du Saint-Esprit in New York, founded in 1628, is older, but it left the French Reformed movement in 1804 to become part of the [Episcopal Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episcopal_Church_(United_States)).

Most of the Huguenot congregations (or individuals) in North America eventually affiliated with other Protestant denominations with more numerous members. The Huguenots adapted quickly and often married outside their immediate French communities, which led to their assimilation.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-72) Their descendants in many families continued to use French first names and surnames for their children well into the nineteenth century. Assimilated, the French made numerous contributions to United States economic life, especially as merchants and artisans in the late Colonial and early Federal periods. For example, [E.I. du Pont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleuth%C3%A8re_Ir%C3%A9n%C3%A9e_du_Pont), a former student of [Lavoisier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavoisier), established the [Eleutherian gunpowder mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleutherian_Mills).[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-73) [Howard Hughes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Hughes), famed investor, pilot, film director, and philanthropist, was also of Huguenot descent and descendant from Rev. [John Gano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gano).

[Paul Revere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Revere) was descended from Huguenot refugees, as was [Henry Laurens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Laurens), who signed the Articles of Confederation for South Carolina; [Jack Jouett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Jouett), who made the ride from Cuckoo Tavern to warn [Thomas Jefferson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson) and others that Tarleton and his men were on their way to arrest him for crimes against the king; Reverend [John Gano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gano) was a [Revolutionary War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War) chaplain and spiritual advisor to [George Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington); [Francis Marion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Marion), and a number of other leaders of the American Revolution and later statesmen. The last active Huguenot congregation in North America worships in Charleston, South Carolina, at a church that dates to 1844. The Huguenot Society of America maintains the [Manakin Episcopal Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Manakin_Episcopal_Church&action=edit&redlink=1) in Virginia as a historic shrine with occasional services. The Society has chapters in numerous states, with the one in Texas being the largest.

### **Spoken language[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Huguenots&action=edit&section=21)]**

The Huguenots originally spoke French on their arrival in the American colonies, but after two or three generations, they had switched to English. They did not promote French-language schools or publications and "lost" their historic identity.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-74) In upstate New York they merged with the Dutch Reformed community and switched first to Dutch and then in the early 19th century to English.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-75) In colonial New York city they switched from French to English or Dutch by 1730.[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-76)

### **Netherlands[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Huguenots&action=edit&section=22)]**

Some Huguenots fought in the Low Countries alongside the Dutch against Spain during the first years of the [Dutch Revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Revolt) (1568–1609). The Dutch Republic rapidly became a destination for Huguenot exiles. Early ties were already visible in the "Apologie" of [William the Silent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_the_Silent), [condemning the Spanish Inquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_revision_of_the_Inquisition), which was written by his court minister, the Huguenot Pierre L'Oyseleur, lord of Villiers. [Louise de Coligny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_de_Coligny), daughter of the murdered Huguenot leader [Gaspard de Coligny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaspard_II_de_Coligny), married William the Silent, leader of the Dutch (Calvinist) revolt against Spanish (Catholic) rule. As both spoke French in daily life, their court church in the [Prinsenhof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prinsenhof) in [Delft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delft) held services in French. The practice has continued to the present day. The Prinsenhof is one of the 14 active [Walloon churches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walloon_church) of the [Dutch Reformed Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Reformed_Church) (now of the [Protestant Church in the Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Church_in_the_Netherlands)). The ties between Huguenots and the Dutch Republic's military and political leadership, the [House of Orange-Nassau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Orange-Nassau), which existed since the early days of the Dutch Revolt, helped support the many early settlements of Huguenots in the Dutch Republic's colonies. They settled at the [Cape of Good Hope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_of_Good_Hope) in South Africa and [New Netherland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Netherland) in North America.

Stadtholder [William III of Orange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_III_of_England), who later became King of England, emerged as the strongest opponent of [king Louis XIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France) after the French attacked the Dutch Republic in 1672. William formed the [League of Augsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Alliance_(League_of_Augsburg)) as a coalition to oppose Louis and the French state. Consequently, many Huguenots considered the wealthy and Calvinist-controlled Dutch Republic, which also happened to lead the opposition to Louis XIV, as the most attractive country for exile after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. They also found many French-speaking Calvinist churches there (which were called the "[Walloon churches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walloon_church)").

After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, the Dutch Republic received the largest group of Huguenot refugees, an estimated total of 75,000 to 100,000 people. Amongst them were 200 pastors. Most came from northern France (Brittany, Normandy, and Picardy, as well as West Flanders (subsequently French Flanders), which had been annexed from the Southern Netherlands by Louis XIV in 1668-78[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-77)). Many came from the region of the [Cévennes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9vennes), for instance, the village of [Fraissinet-de-Lozère](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraissinet-de-Loz%C3%A8re).[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-78) This was a huge influx as the entire population of the Dutch Republic amounted to ca. 2 million at that time. Around 1700, it is estimated that nearly 25% of the Amsterdam population was Huguenot.[[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] In 1705, Amsterdam and the area of West Frisia were the first areas to provide full citizens rights to Huguenot immigrants, followed by the whole Dutch Republic in 1715. Huguenots intermarried with Dutch from the outset.

One of the most prominent Huguenot refugees in the Netherlands was [Pierre Bayle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Bayle). He started teaching in [Rotterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotterdam), where he finished writing and publishing his multi-volume masterpiece, [Historical and Critical Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_and_Critical_Dictionary). It became one of the 100 foundational texts of the US [Library of Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress). Some Huguenot descendants in the Netherlands may be noted by French family names, although they typically use Dutch given names. Due to the Huguenots' early ties with the leadership of the Dutch Revolt and their own participation, some of the Dutch [patriciate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dutch_patrician_families) are of part-Huguenot descent. Some Huguenot families have kept alive various traditions, such as the celebration and feast of their patron [Saint Nicolas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Nicholas), similar to the Dutch Sint Nicolaas ([Sinterklaas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinterklaas)) feast.

As a major Protestant nation, England patronised and helped protect Huguenots, starting with [Queen Elizabeth I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_I) in 1562.[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-79) There was a small naval [Anglo-French War (1627–1629)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-French_War_(1627%E2%80%931629)), in which the English supported the French Huguenots against King Louis XIII of France.[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-80) London financed the emigration of many to England and its colonies around 1700. Some 40,000-50,000 settled in England, mostly in towns near the sea in the southern districts, with the largest concentration in London where they constituted about 5% of the total population in 1700.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-81)[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-82)[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-83) Many others went to the American colonies, especially [South Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_South_Carolina).[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-84)[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-85) The immigrants included many skilled craftsmen and entrepreneurs who facilitated the economic modernisation of their new home, in an era when economic innovations were transferred by people rather than through printed works. The British government ignored the complaints made by local craftsmen about the favouritism shown to foreigners.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-86)[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-87) The immigrants assimilated well in terms of using English, joining the Church of England, intermarriage and business success. They founded the silk industry in England.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-88)[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-89) Many became private tutors, schoolmasters, travelling tutors and owners of riding schools, where they were hired by the upper class.[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-90)

Both before and after the 1708 passage of the [Foreign Protestants Naturalization Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Protestants_Naturalization_Act_1708), an estimated 50,000 Protestant [Walloons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walloons) and French Huguenots fled to England, with many moving on to Ireland and elsewhere. In relative terms, this was one of the largest waves of immigration ever of a single ethnic community to Britain.[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-91) [Andrew Lortie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Lortie) (born André Lortie), a leading Huguenot theologian and writer who led the exiled community in London, became known for articulating their criticism of the Pope and the doctrine of [transubstantiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transubstantiation) during Mass.

Of the refugees who arrived on the [Kent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent) coast, many gravitated towards [Canterbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury), then the county's [Calvinist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinist) hub. Many Walloon and Huguenot families were granted [asylum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum) there. [Edward VI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VI_of_England)granted them the whole of the western crypt of [Canterbury Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury_Cathedral) for worship. In 1825, this privilege was reduced to the south aisle and in 1895 to the former [chantry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chantry) chapel of the [Black Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward,_the_Black_Prince). Services are still held there in French according to the Reformed tradition every Sunday at 3 pm.

Other evidence of the Walloons and Huguenots in Canterbury includes a block of houses in Turnagain Lane, where [weavers' windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weavers%27_windows) survive on the top floor, as many Huguenots worked as weavers. The Weavers, a [half-timbered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timber_framing) house by the river, was the site of a weaving school from the late 16th century to about 1830. (It has been adapted as a restaurant—see illustration above. The house derives its name from a weaving school which was moved there in the last years of the 19th century, reviving an earlier use.) Other refugees practised the variety of occupations necessary to sustain the community as distinct from the indigenous population. Such economic separation was the condition of the refugees' initial acceptance in the city. They also settled elsewhere in Kent, particularly [Sandwich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich,_Kent), [Faversham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faversham,_Kent) and [Maidstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maidstone)—towns in which there used to be refugee churches.

The [French Protestant Church of London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Protestant_Church_of_London) was established by [Royal Charter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Charter) in 1550. It is now located at [Soho Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soho_Square).[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-92) Huguenot refugees flocked to [Shoreditch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoreditch), London. They established a major [weaving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaving) industry in and around [Spitalfields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitalfields) (see [Petticoat Lane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petticoat_Lane) and the [Tenterground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenterground)) in East London.[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-93) In [Wandsworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wandsworth), their gardening skills benefited the [Battersea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battersea) market gardens. The flight of Huguenot refugees from [Tours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tours), France drew off most of the workers of its great silk mills which they had built.[[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] Some of these immigrants moved to [Norwich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwich), which had accommodated an earlier settlement of Walloon weavers. The French added to the existing immigrant population, then comprising about a third of the population of the city.

Some Huguenots settled in Bedfordshire, one of the main centres of the British lace industry at the time. Although 19th-century sources have asserted that some of these refugees were lacemakers and contributed to the East Midlands lace industry,[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-palliser-94)[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-wright-95) this is contentious.[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-96)[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-97) The only reference to immigrant lacemakers in this period is of twenty-five widows who settled in Dover,[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-palliser-94) and there is no contemporary documentation to support there being Huguenot lacemakers in Bedfordshire. The implication that the style of lace known as 'Bucks Point' demonstrates a Huguenot influence, being a "combination of Mechlin patterns on Lille ground",[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-wright-95) is fallacious: what is now known as Mechlin lace did not develop until the first half of the eighteenth century and lace with Mechlin patterns and Lille ground did not appear until the end of the 18th century, when it was widely copied throughout Europe.[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-98)

Many Huguenots from the [Lorraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorraine) region also eventually settled in the area around [Stourbridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stourbridge) in the modern-day [West Midlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Midlands_(county)), where they found the raw materials and fuel to continue their glassmaking tradition. Anglicised names such as Tyzack, Henzey and Tittery are regularly found amongst the early glassmakers, and the region went on to become one of the most important glass regions in the country.[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-99)

[Winston Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill) was the most prominent Briton of Huguenot descent, deriving from the Huguenots who went to the colonies; his American grandfather was [Leonard Jerome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Jerome).

Following the French crown's revocation of the [Edict of Nantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Nantes), many Huguenots settled in Ireland in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, encouraged by an act of parliament for Protestants' settling in Ireland.[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-100)[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-101)[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-102)[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-103)[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-104) Huguenot regiments fought for [William of Orange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_III_of_England) in the [Williamite War in Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamite_War_in_Ireland), for which they were rewarded with land grants and titles, many settling in [Dublin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin).[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-105) Significant Huguenot settlements were in [Dublin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin), [Cork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(city)), [Portarlington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portarlington,_County_Laois), [Lisburn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisburn), [Waterford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterford) and [Youghal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youghal). Smaller settlements, which included [Killeshandra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killeshandra) in County Cavan, contributed to the expansion of flax cultivation and the growth of the [Irish linen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_linen) industry.

For over 150 years, Huguenots were allowed to hold their services in Lady Chapel in [St. Patrick's Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Patrick%27s_Cathedral,_Dublin). A [Huguenot cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenot_Cemetery,_Dublin) is located in the centre of Dublin, off St. Stephen's Green. Prior to its establishment, Huguenots used [the Cabbage Garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cabbage_Garden,_Dublin) near the cathedral. Another, [Huguenot Cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenot_Cemetery,_Cork), is located off French Church street in Cork.

A number of Huguenots served as mayors in Dublin, Cork, Youghal and Waterford in the 17th and 18th centuries. Numerous signs of Huguenot presence can still be seen with names still in use, and with areas of the main towns and cities named after the people who settled there. Examples include the Huguenot District and French Church Street in [Cork City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_City); and [D'Olier Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Olier_Street) in Dublin, named after a High Sheriff and one of the founders of the Bank of Ireland. A French church in Portarlington dates back to 1696,[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-106) and was built to serve the significant new Huguenot community in the town. At the time, they constituted the majority of the townspeople.[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-107)

One of the more notable Huguenot descendants in Ireland was [Seán Lemass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Se%C3%A1n_Lemass) (1899–1971), who was appointed as [Taoiseach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoiseach), serving from 1959 until 1966.

### **Scotland[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Huguenots&action=edit&section=26)]**

With the precedent of a historical alliance - the [Auld Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auld_Alliance) - between Scotland and France; Huguenots were mostly welcomed to, and found refuge in the nation from around the year 1700.[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-108)Although they did not settle in Scotland in such significant numbers, as in other regions of Britain and Ireland, Huguenots have been romanticised, and are generally considered to have contributed greatly to Scottish culture.[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-109) [John Arnold Fleming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Arnold_Fleming) wrote extensively of the French Protestant group's impact on the nation in his 1953 Huguenot Influence in Scotland,[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-110) while sociologist [Abraham Lavender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lavender), who has explored how the ethnic group transformed over generations "from Mediterranean Catholics to White Anglo-Saxon Protestants", has analyzed how Huguenot adherence to [Calvinist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinist) customs helped facilitate compatibility with the Scottish people.[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-111)

### **Wales[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Huguenots&action=edit&section=27)]**

A number of French Huguenots settled in Wales, in the upper [Rhymney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhymney) valley of the current [Caerphilly County Borough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caerphilly_County_Borough). The community they created there is still known as Fleur de Lys (the symbol of France), an unusual French village name in the heart of the valleys of Wales. Nearby villages are [Hengoed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hengoed), and [Ystrad Mynach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ystrad_Mynach). Apart from the French village name and that of the local rugby team, [Fleur De Lys RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleur_De_Lys_RFC), little remains of the French heritage.

Around 1685, Huguenot refugees found a safe haven in the Lutheran and Reformed states in Germany and Scandinavia. Nearly 50,000 Huguenots established themselves in Germany, 20,000 of whom were welcomed in [Brandenburg-Prussia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg-Prussia), where [Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_William,_Elector_of_Brandenburg) and [Duke of Prussia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Prussia) (r. 1649–1688), granted them special privileges ([Edict of Potsdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Potsdam) of 1685) and churches in which to worship (such as the [Church of St. Peter and St. Paul, Angermünde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_St._Peter_and_St._Paul,_Angerm%C3%BCnde) and the [French Cathedral, Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Cathedral,_Berlin)). The Huguenots furnished two new regiments of his army: the Altpreußische Infantry Regiments No. 13 (Regiment on foot Varenne) and 15 (Regiment on foot Wylich). Another 4,000 Huguenots settled in the German territories of [Baden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baden), [Franconia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconia) ([Principality of Bayreuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Bayreuth), [Principality of Ansbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Ansbach)), [Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landgraviate_of_Hesse-Kassel), [Duchy of Württemberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_W%C3%BCrttemberg), in the [Wetterau Association of Imperial Counts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetterau_Association_of_Imperial_Counts), in [the Palatinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electorate_of_the_Palatinate) and [Palatinate-Zweibrücken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatinate-Zweibr%C3%BCcken), in the Rhine-Main-Area ([Frankfurt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt)), in modern-day [Saarland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saarland); and 1,500 found refuge in [Hamburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg), [Bremen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bremen) and [Lower Saxony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Saxony). Three hundred refugees were granted asylum at the court of [George William, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_William,_Duke_of_Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg) in [Celle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celle).

In Berlin the Huguenots created two new neighbourhoods: [Dorotheenstadt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorotheenstadt) and [Friedrichstadt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrichstadt_(Berlin)). By 1700 one fifth of the city's population was French-speaking. The Berlin Huguenots preserved the French language in their church services for nearly a century. They ultimately decided to switch to German in protest against the occupation of Prussia by [Napoleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_I_of_France) in 1806–07. Many of their descendants rose to positions of prominence. Several congregations were founded throughout Germany and Scandinavia, such as those of [Fredericia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredericia) (Denmark), Berlin, [Stockholm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm), Hamburg, [Frankfurt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt), Helsinki, and [Emden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emden).

Prince Louis de Condé, along with his sons Daniel and Osias,[[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] arranged with Count Ludwig von Nassau-Saarbrücken to establish a Huguenot community in present-day [Saarland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saarland) in 1604. The Count supported mercantilism and welcomed technically skilled immigrants into his lands, regardless of their religion. The Condés established a thriving glass-making works, which provided wealth to the principality for many years. Other founding families created enterprises based on textiles and such traditional Huguenot occupations in France. The community and its congregation remain active to this day, with descendants of many of the founding families still living in the region. Some members of this community emigrated to the United States in the 1890s.

In [Bad Karlshafen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Karlshafen), Hessen, Germany is the Huguenot Museum and Huguenot archive. The collection includes family histories, a library, and a picture archive.

### **Effects[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Huguenots&action=edit&section=29)]**

The exodus of Huguenots from France created a [brain drain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_drain), as many of them had occupied important places in society. The kingdom did not fully recover for years. The French crown's refusal to allow non-Catholics to settle in [New France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_France) may help to explain that colony's low population compared to that of the neighbouring British colonies, which opened settlement to religious dissenters. By the start of the [French and Indian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_and_Indian_War), the North American front of the [Seven Years' War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War), a sizeable population of Huguenot descent lived in the British colonies, and many participated in the British defeat of New France in 1759–1760.[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-112)

[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_William,_Elector_of_Brandenburg), invited Huguenots to settle in his realms, and a number of their descendants rose to positions of prominence in Prussia. Several prominent German military, cultural and political figures were ethnic Huguenot, including the poet [Theodor Fontane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Fontane),[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-113) General [Hermann von François](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_von_Fran%C3%A7ois),[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-114) the hero of the [First World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War)'s [Battle of Tannenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tannenberg), [Luftwaffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luftwaffe) General and [fighter ace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_ace) [Adolf Galland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Galland),[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-Galland_1954,_p._vii-115) the Luftwaffe flying ace [Hans-Joachim Marseille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Joachim_Marseille) and the famed [U-boat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-boat) Captains [Lothar von Arnauld de la Perière](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lothar_von_Arnauld_de_la_Peri%C3%A8re) and [Wilhelm Souchon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Souchon).[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-116)The last prime minister of [East Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany), [Lothar de Maizière](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lothar_de_Maizi%C3%A8re),[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-117) is also a descendant of a Huguenot family, as is the German [Federal Minister of the Interior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Ministry_of_the_Interior,_Building_and_Community), [Thomas de Maizière](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_de_Maizi%C3%A8re).

The persecution and the flight of the Huguenots greatly damaged the reputation of Louis XIV abroad, particularly in England. Both kingdoms, which had enjoyed peaceful relations until 1685, became bitter enemies and fought each other in a series of wars, called the "[Second Hundred Years' War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Hundred_Years%27_War)" by some historians, from 1689 onward.

## 1985 apology[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Huguenots&action=edit&section=30)]

[François Mitterrand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Mitterrand)

issued a formal apology to the Huguenots and their descendants on behalf of the French state in 1985

In October 1985, to commemorate the tricentenary of the [Revocation of the Edict of Nantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revocation_of_the_Edict_of_Nantes), President [François Mitterrand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Mitterrand) of France announced a formal apology to the descendants of Huguenots around the world.[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-118) At the same time, the government released a special postage stamp in their honour reading "France is the home of the Huguenots" (Accueil des Huguenots).

### **South Africa[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Huguenots&action=edit&section=37)]**

*Main article: [Huguenots in South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots_in_South_Africa)*

- Most South African Huguenots settled in the [Cape Colony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Colony), where they became assimilated into the [Afrikaner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaner) and [Afrikaans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaans) population. Many modern Afrikaners have French surnames, which are given Afrikaans pronunciation and orthography. The early immigrants settled in  ("French Corner") near [Cape Town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town). The Huguenots contributed greatly to the [wine industry in South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_wine).

    [Franschhoek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franschhoek)

    [[129]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-129)

### **Australia[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Huguenots&action=edit&section=38)]**

*Main article: [French Australian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Australian)*

- The majority of Australians with French ancestry are descended from Huguenots. Some of the earliest to arrive in Australia held prominent positions in English society, notably [Jane Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Franklin)and [Charles La Trobe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_La_Trobe).

    [[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots#cite_note-130)

- Others who came later were from poorer families, migrating from England in the 19th and early 20th centuries to escape the poverty of London's East End Huguenot enclaves of [Spitalfields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitalfields) and [Bethnal Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethnal_Green). Their impoverishment had been brought on by the Industrial Revolution, which caused the collapse of the Huguenot-dominated silk-weaving industry. Many [French Australian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Australian)descendants of Huguenots still consider themselves very much Huguenots or French, even in the twenty-first century.
