The Forks of the Brandywine Presbyterian Church, also known as the Brandywine Manor Church, was organized by and comprised of a majority of Scottish and Scotch-Irish settlers. In 1735 Edward Irwin was officially a ruling elder in the Forks of the Brandywine Manor Presbyterian Church. In 1736, he served as a Commissioner from this church and was sent to the Presbytery to present a call to a Rev. Black. Rev. Black's salary was to be 55 pounds in Pennsylvania currency. The first pastor to "The Forks" during this pioneer period was the Reverend Samuel Black. In 1761, the Reverend John Carmichael, a native of Scotland, was installed as pastor. Known as the "Revolutionary Pastor," Reverend Carmichael whole heartedly supported the "revolution." He preached before Congress, was present at the Battle of Long Island and urged enlistment into the army.
