Thomas sold his property in Chester and Lancaster PA. to his brother Jessie in 1842 and moved to Knox, OH. On Feb 2, 1847 he met Anna Spry and they married. (It is believed that Margaret Irwin and Thomas Hoar had divorced in 1840). Papers showing a divorce were never found and it is questionable if they actual divorced. No marriage license was found for Margaret's marriage to a William Brinley. But a marriage license was found for Thomas Hoar and his marriage to Ann Spry in 1847. 

They had four children and the 1850 census show that William Bramwell was living in the home with Thomas and Anna. Thomas and Anna moved to Fulton County, Illinois. In 1877 they left Illinois and with other members of their family moved to Ash Rock Township Rooks County, Kansas. Thomas died before he was able to prove on his land.
