# Absalom Benjamin Butler's Illegitimate Roots

Absalom Benjamin Butler was born illegitimate on Feb 19 1848 near Monroe, Green County Wisconsin, to Mary Jane Yeazel. Mary Jane is the daughter of John Yeazel Sr. b 1784 and Sophia Stader b. 1790 in N.C. John and Sophia were married March 22, 1810 in Montgomery county, OH. They came to Green Co. WI about 1841. Mary Jane was born in 1830 in Indiana or Illinois.

Mary Jane's older sister, Catherine, was married to Mordecai Kelly, who was an early settler in Green Co., WI. Plete Kelly, who was a grand-daughter of Mordecai, related the following story about Mary Jane and Absolom: There was a meeting the country folks had at a school house, which must have been close to the Mordecai place. Mary Jane and Absolom (her baby) were there. The kid must have been abut a year old. Most of the women were trying to figure out who it looked like.

So apprently Mary Jane never told anyone who the real father was.

When Absalom was about 3 yrs old his mother married Harrison Heater on Feb 6, 1851 in Monroe Township, Green Co, WI. Harrison changed Absolom's middle name from Benjamin to Henry and gave him his last name but never did adopt him legeally.

In 1857-1858 the family moved to Champaign Co. Illinois and by 1860 were living in Ford Co, Illinois about 5 miles SW of Paxton. It was here that Absalom ran away from home 5 times in order to join the Union Army. Each time he was caught by his step-father and forced to return home. He finally made his get a way on Feb 8, 1865 when he enlisted in CO A of the 154th Ill Infantry at Urbana, Illinois. He enlisted as Absalom H Heater. He claimed he was 18, the minimum age to enter, but was on 16 yrs old, 11 days shy of his 17th birthday. He served until Sept 18, 1865 when he was honorably discharged in Nashville, TN.

Absalom never knew that Harrison Heater was not his true father until about a year after he came home from the Civil War. His mother, who was very sick and on her death bed, told him that his real father was a man named Butler and that his true name was Absalom Benjamin Butler. He took that name then and there and used and claimed it and was known by that name every since.

Absalom's death certificate listed him born Feb 19, 1845, but he was actually born 1848. A search of WI census 1846, 1847,and 1850 puts his age matching being born in 1848. If you check his death certificate it lists his father as AB Butler and his father is from Ireland.

When searching the WI state census for the years 1846-47, there was, living in the same neighborhood as the Yeazels, a man named Absalom Butler who was married and had 3 children. What's interesting is that one of these children was also a son with the name Absalom who was born 1825. Could the son or his father be the true father to Absalom Benjamin? The father was married to a Jane and in records it shows that they sold land in Green Co. in April 1849 and Oct 1851. Records also show a history of this family that they are indeed descended of Scottish origin.
