# Áed Find

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

**Áed Find** (Áed the White), or **Áed mac Echdach** (before 736–778), was king of [Dál Riata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A1l_Riata) (modern western [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland) and County Antrim, Ireland). Áed was the son of [Eochaid mac Echdach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eochaid_mac_Echdach), a descendant of [Domnall Brecc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domnall_Brecc) in the main line of [Cenél nGabráin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cen%C3%A9l_nGabr%C3%A1in) kings.[[note 1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81ed_Find#cite_note-1)

According to later genealogies, Áed was the great-grandfather of [Kenneth MacAlpin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_I_of_Scotland) (Cináed mac Ailpín) who is traditionally counted as the first [king of Scots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Scots). This descent ran through Áed's son [Eochaid mac Áeda Find](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eochaid_mac_%C3%81eda_Find) and Eochaid's son [Alpín mac Echdach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alp%C3%ADn_mac_Echdach). The evidence for the existence of Eochaid and Alpín is late and uncompelling, and shows signs of fabrication in the [High Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland_in_the_High_Middle_Ages).

The [Annals of Ulster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annals_of_Ulster) in 768 report "Bellum i Fortrinn iter Aedh & Cinaedh": a battle in [Fortriu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortriu) between Áed and Cináed. This is usually read as meaning Áed Find and the [Pictish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picts) king [Ciniod I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciniod_I_of_the_Picts), who is called "Cinadhon" in the notice of his death in 775. The [Annals of the Four Masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annals_of_the_Four_Masters), a less reliable source, give a different version, placing this battle in [Leinster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leinster) and naming the victor as Cináed mac Flainn of the Uí Failgi and his defeated enemy as one Áed.

Áed's death in 778 is noted by the Annals of Ulster. He appears to have been followed as king by his brother [Fergus mac Echdach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fergus_mac_Echdach).

The "Laws of Áed Eochaid's son" are mentioned by the [Chronicle of the Kings of Alba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicle_of_the_Kings_of_Alba) in the reign of Áed's supposed great-grandson [Donald MacAlpin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_I_of_Scotland) (Domnall mac Ailpín): "In his time the [Gaels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaels)with their king made the rights and laws of the kingdom [that are called the laws] of Áed Eochaid's son, in [Forteviot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forteviot)." What these laws concerned is not known.

## In fiction

Áed Find is playable in [Crusader Kings II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusader_Kings_II) (under the [regnal name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regnal_name) Áed III) in the Charlemagne [DLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content)'s 769 AD start date, and is treated as an independent [duke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke). His son Eochaid and brother Fergus also exist in his court. Without player intervention his realm is usually quickly conquered by neighboring [Pictland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictland).
