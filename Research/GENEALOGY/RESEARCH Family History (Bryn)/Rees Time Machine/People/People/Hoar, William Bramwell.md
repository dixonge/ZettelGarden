Summary: Hoar, William Bramwell (M) (74 yrs)
[B] Sep 25, 1837 - [D] Dec 28, 1911

William Bramwell was 5' 8" tall, had a fair complexion, auburn hair and brown eyes. He was remembered as a quiet man. Mary Helen was a kind lady with a lot of courage. She was described to me by Emma Churchill Jackson as heavy set and a little taller then William.

William Bramwell, a veteran of the Civil War, received a monthly pension of $12.00 and later Mary Helen applied for a widow's pension and was granted $10.00 a month. Grandpa Charles remembered his father telling stories about his Civil War experiences. He was in Sherman's March to the Sea and told how he marched in snow with worn out shoes and injured feet, leaving blood spots in the snow. He was grazed by a bullet across his scalp and was treated several times for intestinal fever and dysentery. Charles told how he used to sing songs of the Civil war. Following his discharge from the army 21 June 1865, William Bramwell returned to Fulton County, Illinois and six months later married Mary Helen Churchill. The ceremony was performed by the Minister, J. B. Ross and was held in the home of Mary's parents, William Stewart and Melvina Churchill. The date was 14 December 1865.

Twelve children were born to this union, the first seven in Cuba, Illinois. My Grandfather Charles was the third child born to this marriage. A son, Harry, died of pneumonia at the age of three years and is buried in the Cuba cemetery.

In 1877 the family left Illinois and moved to Ash Rock Township, Rooks County, Kansas. They traveled by covered wagon and there were several other wagons in the party. Part of the group that made this trip were Thomas, the father of William Bramwell, his wife, Anna and their daughter, Rhoda. Also traveling with the group was Tillman, his wife, Harriet and George David Hoar, his wife, Sarah Elizabeth. Tillman, Rhoda and Sarah Elizabeth were half brother and sisters to William Bramwell. It must have been a difficult trip with ten small children, the youngest, Cora, was only 6 months old.

It is almost an American tradition to move westward, it is a difficult thing to gauge, but nevertheless it is a powerful force. The westward migration which began before the American Revolution, contributed to a degree, to the restlessness that seem to be unique to the American people. This was probably a factor in the migration of our early ancestors from England, Connecticut and Pennsylvania.

The primary reason the early settlers came to Kansas was to obtain land. Often several generations would pull up stakes and move as a group to a new location where they could all obtain land and still live close to each other. This is the way our ancestors arrived in Rooks County, Kansas.

The township of Ash Rock is located in the northeast corner of Rooks County, with Osborne County to the east and Smith and Phillips Counties on the north.

The Pre-emption Act of 1841 permitted an actual settler to purchase up to 160 acres at a minimum price of $1.25 per acre. The Homestead Act of 1862 permitted an actual settler who was a citizen of the United States to obtain up to 160 acres by paying a filing fee of $10.00, build a house and live on the land for at least 5 years. If all these conditions were met, then a patent was issued by the President of the United States.

The big rush for land began in 1877 and reached its peak in 1878. By 1880 most quarter-sections in the township were claimed. The Hoar family were some of the 35 that filed in 1877 and stayed to obtain title. By 1880 the township had a population of 483; this was the largest population that it would record. The Hoar family faced many hard times: the unpredictability of Kansas weather, from floods to drought, from scorching heat to frigid blizzards, severe windstorms, tornadoes, thunderstorms and hail. They faced economic hard times, disease, crop failures, isolation and the death of children and young adults.

The first priority of the early settler was to build some sort of a shelter. The Hoar's first dwelling was a dugout. The dugout was the easiest type of dwelling to build, because it was little more than a cave in an embankment. As soon as possible a room made of sod (soddy) was added. During the early years they were a part of the widespread phenomenon known as the sod-house frontier. Sod houses were built by turning over the prairie with a sod plow that cut about four inches deep, the sod was then laid over a strip of land from fourteen to twenty inches wide. The strip was chopped into "bricks" about two to three feet in length and then laid grass side down, in an overlaping fashion to construct walls. Openings were left for doors and windows, with wood used to support the openings. The roof was built on poles supported by forked poles in the ends and usually covered with sticks or branches and topped with sod.

Another area of concern for the pioneers was the supply of fuel and energy. Traditionally, pioneers had burned wood for cooking and heating, but timber was in short supply on the prairie. Most of the people burned chips, buffalo chips as they called them, but the majority of those that they found were undoubtedly dropped by cattle.

It has been said that "travel on the plains and frontier life was particularly severe on women and oxen." The wives bore many children and they worked hard to feed, clothe and keep clean a growing family. They fought a constant battle with the dust, flies and other irritants. They did all of the household duties, without benefit of the so called modern conveniences. They did the milking, made butter and cheese and raised flocks of chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese.

Childbirth was often dreaded on the frontier where physicians were far away and midwives were often inexperienced. Tillman, the half brother of William Bramwell and his wife had 5 infants buried at the Spring Branch Cemetery before the year 1880. Mary Helen and William Bramwell had twelve children. At the time that the last child Mary was born, in the year 1889, Mary Helen was 42 years old. Their oldest child, Clara, had two babies buried in Ash Rock and later when she was pregnant she went blind and died of kidney poisoning, 6 July 1889, at the age of twenty-three. My mother is named after Clara and Clara's birthday was the same as mine, the 8th of October. Mary Helen could not attend her daughter's funeral as she was ready to have her baby, Mary.

It was the land that brought William Bramwell and Mary Helen Hoar to Ash Rock. They wanted the land as property and they wanted to farm the soil. It was the land that supported them. In 1877, William B. and Mary Helen filed their homestead on the Southeast Quarter of 15-6-16, and they received their final patent or title of ownership. In 1899 they purchased another quarter section of land. By the time the last two children were born they had built a frame house and in about 1903 they had added another room. Mother (MoMo) remembered the farm house and the big barn that they had and she recalled visiting them.

William Bramwell and Mary Helen retired to Woodston. Their daughter Louisa and her husband, Cal Crawford moved onto the homestead. Later, they sold the farm to another daughter and her husband, Cora and Everett LaRue and then in 1917 the property passed from the heirs of William Bramwell and was sold to R. Rector. William B. sold his remaining property to Clarence Balmer. William B. and Mary Helen built a new home in Woodston. We were able to locate this property and were quite shocked as to the condition; it was in shambles and being used for storage.

William Bramwell died at Woodston 28 December 1911 at the age of 74, only a few years after he retired. Mary Helen Churchill Hoar died at the home of her daughter, Margaret, in Alton, Kansas 25 March 1931 at the age of 84. Both are buried in the Ash Rock Cemetery. The property where the cemetery is located and the property to the rear of the church was part of William Bramwell Hoar's homestead. The road between the cemetery and the church was the boundary line of the property. His home was located northwest of the church.

THE ASH ROCK CHURCH

The Ash Rock Congregational Church was built in 1882 and is located 5 miles north and 1 mile east of Woodston, held it's first services 4 March 1883. Sometimes called the "Stone Church" because of its thick, limestone walls, the church stands as a memorial to the spirit and hard work of those who settled the land, survived its hard times and enjoyed its good times. The church was renovated in 1976 to its present condition.

ASH ROCK CEMETERY

This cemetery is often referred to as the Stone Church Cemetery, but the official name is Ash Rock Cemetery. This cemetery is owned and well maintained by the historical Ash Rock Congregational Church.
