William was born on that same farm during the early twenties of the past century, a son of George and Catherine (Henley) Weaver natives of PA who came from that state to Indiana in the early days of the settlement of this part of the state and after a sometime residence in Wayne county came to Fayette Co. William Weaver grew up on the farm southeast of Bentonville. He md Lovisa Messersmith, dau of Hiram Messersmith and wife, pioneers of that section of the county. After his marriage William Weaver for two years made his home on what is now known as the old Rodney Shipley farm northeast of Yankeetown and then he moved to Madison county, where he bought a farm and where he made his home for twelve years, at the end of which time he returned to the farm on which he was born, southeast of Bentonville, and after four years there moved to a farm just on the eastern edge of Bentonville and tence, after awhile, to a farm two and one half miles southwest of Bentonville and from there back to his farm in Madison county, where he spent the remainder of his life, his death occurring about 1882. His wife had died about 1863, by which time two of his children were grown and married, and for sometime afterward he kept the younger children together, his son, George H., remaining with him until he was sixteen years of age, when he began working for his uncle, John Weaver, on the latter's farm northwest of Bentonville, where he remained for six years, at the end of which time he returned to the old home place and after his marriage a year later established his home there.
