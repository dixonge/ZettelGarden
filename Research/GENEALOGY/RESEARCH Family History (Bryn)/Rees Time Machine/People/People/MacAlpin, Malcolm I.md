**Máel Coluim mac Domnaill** ([anglicised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicised) **Malcolm I**) (died 954) was [king of Alba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Alba) (before 943 – 954), becoming king when his cousin [Constantine II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_II_of_Scotland)abdicated to become a monk. He was the son of [Donald II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_II).

Máel Coluim was probably born during his father's reign (889–900).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_I#cite_note-1) By the 940s, he was no longer a young man, and may have become impatient in awaiting the throne. Willingly or not—the 11th-century [Prophecy of Berchán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophecy_of_Berch%C3%A1n), a verse history in the form of a supposed prophecy, states that it was not a voluntary decision that Constantine II abdicated in 943 and entered a monastery, leaving the kingdom to Máel Coluim.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_I#cite_note-2)

Seven years later, the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba says:

> [Malcolm I] plundered the English as far as the River Tees, and he seized a multitude of people and many herds of cattle: and the Scots called this the raid of Albidosorum, that is, Nainndisi. But others say that Constantine made this raid, asking of the king, Malcolm, that the kingship should be given to him for a week's time, so that he could visit the English. In fact, it was Malcolm who made the raid, but Constantine incited him, as I have said.[3]

Woolf suggests that the association of Constantine with the raid is a late addition, one derived from a now-lost saga or poem.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_I#cite_note-4)

He died in the shield wall next to his men.[[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] Máel Coluim would be the third in his immediate family to die violently, his father [Donald II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_II_of_Scotland) and grandfather [Constantine I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_I_of_Scotland) both having met similar fates 54 years earlier in 900 and 77 years earlier in 877 respectively.

In 945, [Edmund I of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_I_of_England), having expelled [Amlaíb Cuaran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaf_Cuaran) (Olaf Sihtricsson) from [Northumbria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northumbria), devastated [Cumbria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumbria) and blinded two sons of [Domnall mac Eógain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domnall_III_of_Strathclyde), king of [Strathclyde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Strathclyde). It is said that he then "let" or "commended" Strathclyde to Máel Coluim in return for an alliance.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_I#cite_note-5) What is to be understood by "let" or "commended" is unclear, but it may well mean that Máel Coluim had been the overlord of Strathclyde and that Edmund recognised this while taking lands in southern Cumbria for himself.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_I#cite_note-6)

The [Chronicle of the Kings of Alba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicle_of_the_Kings_of_Alba) says that Máel Coluim took an army into [Moray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormaerdom_of_Moray) "and slew Cellach". Cellach is not named in the surviving genealogies of the [rulers of Moray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormaer_of_Moray), and his identity is unknown.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_I#cite_note-7)

Máel Coluim appears to have kept his agreement with the late English king, which may have been renewed with the new king, Edmund having been murdered in 946 and succeeded by his brother [Edred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edred_of_England). [Eric Bloodaxe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Bloodaxe), son to King Harald Hairfair of Norway, took [York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York) in 948, before being driven out by Edred, and when Amlaíb Cuaran again took [York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York) in 949–950, Máel Coluim raided Northumbria as far south as the [Tees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Tees) taking "a multitude of people and many herds of cattle" according to the Chronicle.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_I#cite_note-8) The [Annals of Ulster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annals_of_Ulster) for 952 report a battle between "the men of Alba and the Britons [of Strathclyde] and the English" against the foreigners, i.e., the Northmen or the [Norse-Gaels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse-Gaels). This battle is not reported by the [Anglo-Saxon Chronicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle), and it is unclear whether it should be related to the expulsion of Amlaíb Cuaran from York or the return of Eric Bloodaxe.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_I#cite_note-9)

The Annals of Ulster report that Máel Coluim was killed in 954. Other sources place this most probably in the [Mearns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kincardineshire), either at [Fetteresso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetteresso_Castle) following the Chronicle, or at [Dunnottar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunnottar) following the [Prophecy of Berchán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophecy_of_Berch%C3%A1n). He was buried on [Iona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iona).[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_I#cite_note-10) Máel Coluim's sons [Dub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dub,_King_of_Scotland) and [Cináed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_II_of_Scotland) were later kings.
