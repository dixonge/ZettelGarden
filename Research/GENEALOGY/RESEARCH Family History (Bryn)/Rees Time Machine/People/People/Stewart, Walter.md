**Walter Steward of Dundonald** (died 1246)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Stewart,_3rd_High_Steward_of_Scotland#cite_note-1) was 3rd hereditary [High Steward of Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Steward_of_Scotland) and [Justiciar of Scotia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justiciar_of_Scotia).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Stewart,_3rd_High_Steward_of_Scotland#cite_note-2)

He was the eldest son of [Alan fitz Walter, 2nd High Steward of Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_fitz_Walter,_2nd_High_Steward_of_Scotland) but which wife of Alan's was his mother is not clear. He was the first member of the [House of Stuart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Stuart) to use Stewart as a surname, and was designated "of Dundonald".[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Stewart,_3rd_High_Steward_of_Scotland#cite_note-3)

He witnessed a charter by [King Alexander II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_II_of_Scotland), under the designation of "Walterus filius Alani, Senescallus, Justiciar Scotiae"[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Stewart,_3rd_High_Steward_of_Scotland#cite_note-4) and it may be that seal which [Nisbet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Nisbet) described pertaining to Walter Hereditary High Steward of Scotland. Around the seal it states "Sigill. Walteri filii Allani".[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Stewart,_3rd_High_Steward_of_Scotland#cite_note-5)
