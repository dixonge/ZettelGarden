# Domnall Brecc

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

**Domnall Brecc** (Welsh: Dyfnwal Frych; English: Donald the Freckled) (died 642 in [Strathcarron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Carron_(Forth))) was king of [Dál Riata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A1l_Riata), in modern [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland), from about 629 until 642. He was the son of [Eochaid Buide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eochaid_Buide).

He first appears in 622, when the [Annals of Tigernach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annals_of_Tigernach) report his presence at the battle of Cend Delgthen (probably in the east midlands of Ireland) as an ally of [Conall Guthbinn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conall_Guthbinn) of [Clann Cholmáin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clann_Cholm%C3%A1in). This is the only battle known where Domnall Brecc fought on the winning side.

Domnall suffered four defeats after he broke Dál Riata's alliance with the [Cenél Conaill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cen%C3%A9l_Conaill) clan of the [Uí Néill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U%C3%AD_N%C3%A9ill). In [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland), Domnall and his ally [Congal Cáech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congal_C%C3%A1ech) of the [Dál nAraidi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A1l_nAraidi) were defeated by [Domnall mac Áedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domnall_mac_%C3%81edo) of the [Cenél Conaill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cen%C3%A9l_Conaill), the [High King of Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_King_of_Ireland), at the [Battle of Mag Rath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mag_Rath) ([Moira, County Down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moira,_County_Down)) in 637. He also lost to the [Picts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picts) in 635 and 638 and lastly to [Eugein I of Alt Clut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugein_I_of_Alt_Clut) at Strathcarron in 642, where he was killed.

A stanza interpolated into the ancient Welsh poem [Y Gododdin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Gododdin) refers to these events:

> I saw an array that came from Pentir,And bore themselves splendidly around the conflagration.I saw a second one, rapidly descending from their township,Who had risen at the word of the grandson of Nwython.[1]I saw great sturdy men who came with the dawn,And the head of Dyfnwal Frych, ravens gnawed it.

Domnall's son [Domangart mac Domnaill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domangart_mac_Domnaill) was later to be king of Dál Riata and from him the later kings of the [Cenél nGabráin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cen%C3%A9l_nGabr%C3%A1in) were descended. A second son, Cathasach, died c. 650, and a grandson of Domnall, also called Cathasach, died c. 688.

## Notes

**[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domnall_Brecc#cite_ref-1)** Eugein was the grandson of Nwython ([Neithon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neithon_of_Alt_Clut)).
