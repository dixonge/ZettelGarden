## Notes

[wikipdia.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eochaid) lists 20 Eochaid's

Also, "According to the 12th century Lebor Gabála Érenn, he took power when he defeated the previous High King, Fachtna Fáthach, in the Battle of Leitir Rúaid.[2] The Middle Irish saga Cath Leitrech Ruibhe tells the story of this battle. While Fachtna Fáthach was away from Tara on a visit to Ulster, Eochu, then king of Connacht, raised an army, had the provincial kings killed and took hostages from Tara. When news reached Fachtna at Emain Macha, he raised an army of Ulstermen and gave battle at Leitir Rúaid in the Corann (modern County Sligo),[3] but was defeated and beheaded by Eochu. Eochaid Sálbuide, the king of Ulster, was also killed. Fergus mac Róich covered the Ulster army's retreat, and Eochu marched to Tara.[4]"[wikipedia.com=feidlech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eochu_Feidlech)

I just adopted Eochaid, which means "Hugh" I have seen......

This person is not quite the same name as I have seen on my family Gene Historian sites. The Sue Wilcox-Hosbach [[1]](http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=wwofn&id=I45022) AND the Ralph Terry site who names his sources as: Information from: see SOURCES
