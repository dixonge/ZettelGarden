# Domangart Réti

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

**Domangart Réti** was king of [Dál Riata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A1l_Riata) in the early 6th century, following the death of his father, [Fergus Mór](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fergus_M%C3%B3r).

He had at least two sons: [Comgall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comgall_mac_Domangairt) and [Gabrán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabr%C3%A1n_mac_Domangairt), both of whom became kings in succession. The [Tripartite Life of St. Patrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripartite_Life_of_St._Patrick) states that he was present at the death of the saint, c. 493. Domangart died around 507 and was succeeded by Comgall.

His byname, Réti, appears in [Adomnán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adomn%C3%A1n)'s Life of Saint [Columba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columba), in the form **Corcu Réti**, perhaps a synonym for Dál Riata. Corcu, a [Primitive Irish language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_Irish_language) term for a kin group, usually combined with the name of a divine or mythical ancestor, is apparently similar to the term Dál. Alternatively, rather than representing an alternative name for all of Dál Riata, it has been suggested Corcu Réti was the name given to the kin group which later divided to form the [Cenél nGabráin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cen%C3%A9l_nGabr%C3%A1in) of [Kintyre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintyre) and the [Cenél Comgaill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cen%C3%A9l_Comgaill) of [Cowal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowal), thus excluding the [Cenél nÓengusa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cen%C3%A9l_n%C3%93engusa) of [Islay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islay) and the [Cenél Loairn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cen%C3%A9l_Loairn) of middle and northern [Argyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argyll).
