## Life

Alan was the son and heir of [Walter fitz Alan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_fitz_Alan), by his spouse Eschina, who was possibly a member of a family from the south of Scotland. From 1178, the time of his succession to his father, until his death in 1204, Alan served as Steward of Scotland ([dapifer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dapifer)) to [William the Lion, King of Scots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_the_Lion,_King_of_Scots).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_fitz_Walter,_2nd_High_Steward_of_Scotland#cite_note-Barrow-family-1) It was during Alan's lifetime that his family acquired the [Isle of Bute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Bute).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_fitz_Walter,_2nd_High_Steward_of_Scotland#cite_note-Barrow-family-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_fitz_Walter,_2nd_High_Steward_of_Scotland#cite_note-2) He was possibly responsible for the erection of [Rothesay Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothesay_Castle) on the island.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_fitz_Walter,_2nd_High_Steward_of_Scotland#cite_note-Barrow-family-1)

Alan allegedly accompanied [Richard the Lionheart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_I_of_England) on the Third Crusade, from which he returned to Scotland in July 1191. None of the references, however, can be traced back to the period.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_fitz_Walter,_2nd_High_Steward_of_Scotland#cite_note-Simpson,_David_1713-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_fitz_Walter,_2nd_High_Steward_of_Scotland#cite_note-4)

A Royal Grant to [Kinloss Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinloss_Abbey), signed at [Melrose Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melrose_Abbey) was made between 1179 and 1183. Amongst the witnesses are the Abbot of Melrose, the Abbot of [Newbottle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newbattle_Abbey), [Richard de Morville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_de_Morville), Constable of Scotland, 'Alan, son of Walter the Steward, and William de Lauder.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_fitz_Walter,_2nd_High_Steward_of_Scotland#cite_note-5)

Alan became a patron of the [Knights Templar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Templar) and is responsible for expanding Templar influence in Scotland. There is no evidence, however, that he joined the Order before his death.

He appears as a witness to other charters of William The Lion.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_fitz_Walter,_2nd_High_Steward_of_Scotland#cite_note-6)

He is buried with his father in [Paisley Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paisley_Abbey).

## Marriage and issue

They had no known issue.

By his second marriage to Alesta, daughter of [Morggán, Earl of Mar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgg%C3%A1n,_Earl_of_Mar)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_fitz_Walter,_2nd_High_Steward_of_Scotland#cite_note-Simpson,_David_1713-3) [[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_fitz_Walter,_2nd_High_Steward_of_Scotland#cite_note-Burke,_Messrs_1851-7) and Ada, he had issue:

- David, died without issue, before his father.
