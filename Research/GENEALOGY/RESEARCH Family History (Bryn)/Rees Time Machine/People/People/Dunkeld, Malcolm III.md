**Malcolm III** ([Scottish Gaelic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic_language): Máel Coluim mac Donnchada; c. 26 March 1031 – 13 November 1093 (age 62) was [King of Scots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Scots) from 1058 to 1093. He was later nicknamed "**Canmore**" ("ceann mòr", [Gaelic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic) for "Great Chief": "ceann" denotes "leader", "head" (of state) and "mòr" denotes "pre-eminent", "great", and "big").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-2) Malcolm's long reign of 35 years preceded the beginning of the [Scoto-Norman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoto-Norman) age. [Henry I of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_I_of_England) and [Eustace III of Boulogne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustace_III_of_Boulogne) were his sons-in-law, making him the maternal grandfather of [Empress Matilda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Matilda), [William Adelin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Adelin) and [Matilda of Boulogne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matilda_of_Boulogne). All three of them were prominent in English politics during the 12th century.

Malcolm's kingdom did not extend over the full territory of modern [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland): the north and west of Scotland remained under [Scandinavian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia) rule following the Norse invasions. Malcolm III fought a series of wars against the [Kingdom of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_England), which may have had as its objective the conquest of the English earldom of [Northumbria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northumbria). These wars did not result in any significant advances southward. Malcolm's primary achievement was to continue a lineage that ruled Scotland for many years,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-3) although his role as founder of a dynasty has more to do with the propaganda of his youngest son [David I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_I_of_Scotland) and his descendants than with history.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-4)

Malcolm's second wife, [St. Margaret of Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Margaret_of_Scotland), is Scotland's only royal saint. Malcolm himself had no reputation for piety; with the notable exception of [Dunfermline Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunfermline_Abbey) in [Fife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fife), he is not definitely associated with major religious establishments or ecclesiastical reforms.

## Background

*Main article: [Scotland in the High Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland_in_the_High_Middle_Ages)*

Malcolm's father [Duncan I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_I_of_Scotland) became king in late 1034, on the death of [Malcolm II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_II_of_Scotland), Duncan's maternal grandfather and Malcolm's great-grandfather. According to [John of Fordun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_Fordun), whose account is the original source of part of [William Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare)'s [Macbeth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbeth), Malcolm's mother was a niece of [Siward, Earl of Northumbria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siward,_Earl_of_Northumbria),[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-6) but an earlier king-list gives her the Gaelic name Suthen.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-7) Other sources claim that either a daughter or niece would have been too young to fit the timeline, thus the likely relative would have been Siward's own sister Sybil, which may have translated into Gaelic as Suthen.

Duncan's reign was not successful and he was killed in battle with the men of Moray, led by [Macbeth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbeth_of_Scotland), on 15 August 1040. Duncan was young at the time of his death,[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-8) and Malcolm and his brother [Donalbane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_III_of_Scotland) were children.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-9) Malcolm's family attempted to overthrow Macbeth in 1045, but Malcolm's grandfather [Crínán of Dunkeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%ADn%C3%A1n_of_Dunkeld) was killed in the attempt.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-10)

Soon after the death of Duncan his two young sons were sent away for greater safety—exactly where is the subject of debate. According to one version, Malcolm (then aged about nine) was sent to England,[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-11) and his younger brother Donalbane was sent to the Isles.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-13) Based on Fordun's account, it was assumed that Malcolm passed most of Macbeth's seventeen-year reign in the [Kingdom of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_England) at the court of [Edward the Confessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_the_Confessor).[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-14)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-15) Today's British royal family can trace their family history back to Malcolm III via his daughter [Matilda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matilda_of_Scotland) as well as his son [David I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_I_of_Scotland), an ancestor of [Robert the Bruce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_the_Bruce) and thus also the [Stewart/Stuart kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Stuart).

According to an alternative version, Malcolm's mother took both sons into exile at the court of [Thorfinn Sigurdsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorfinn_Sigurdsson), [Earl of Orkney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_of_Orkney), an enemy of Macbeth's family, and perhaps Duncan's kinsman by marriage.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-16)

An English invasion in 1054, with [Siward, Earl of Northumbria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siward,_Earl_of_Northumbria) in command, had as its goal the installation of one "[Máel Coluim, son of the king of the Cumbrians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A1el_Coluim,_son_of_the_king_of_the_Cumbrians)". This Máel Coluim has traditionally been identified with the later Malcolm III.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-17) This interpretation derives from the Chronicle attributed to the 14th-century chronicler of Scotland, John of Fordun, as well as from earlier sources such as William of Malmesbury.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-18) The latter reported that Macbeth was killed in the battle by Siward, but it is known that Macbeth outlived Siward by two years.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-19) [A. A. M. Duncan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._A._M._Duncan) argued in 2002 that, using the [Anglo-Saxon Chronicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle) entry as their source, later writers innocently misidentified "Máel Coluim" with the later Scottish king of the same name.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-20) Duncan's argument has been supported by several subsequent historians specialising in the era, such as [Richard Oram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Oram), [Dauvit Broun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dauvit_Broun) and Alex Woolf.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-21) It has also been suggested that Máel Coluim may have been a son of [Owain Foel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owain_Foel), British king of [Strathclyde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Strathclyde)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-22) perhaps by a daughter of [Malcolm II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_II), King of Scotland.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-23)

In 1057 various chroniclers report the death of Macbeth at Malcolm's hand, on 15 August 1057 at [Lumphanan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumphanan) in [Aberdeenshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeenshire_(historic)).[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-24)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-25) Macbeth was succeeded by his stepson [Lulach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lulach), who was crowned at [Scone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scone,_Scotland), probably on 8 September 1057. Lulach was killed by Malcolm, "by treachery",[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-26) near [Huntly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntly,_Scotland) on 23 April 1058. After this, Malcolm became king, perhaps being inaugurated on 25 April 1058, although only John of Fordun reports this.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-27)

## Marriage to Ingiborg

If [Orderic Vitalis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orderic_Vitalis) is to be relied upon, one of Malcolm's earliest actions as king was to travel to the court of [Edward the Confessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_the_Confessor) in 1059 to arrange a marriage with Edward's kinswoman [Margaret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Margaret_of_Scotland), who had arrived in England two years before from [Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary).[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-28) If a marriage agreement was made in 1059, it was not kept, and this may explain the Scots invasion of Northumbria in 1061 when [Lindisfarne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindisfarne) was plundered.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-29) Equally, Malcolm's raids in Northumbria may have been related to the disputed "Kingdom of the Cumbrians", reestablished by Earl Siward in 1054, which was under Malcolm's control by 1070.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-30)

The [Orkneyinga saga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orkneyinga_saga) reports that Malcolm married the widow of Thorfinn Sigurdsson, [Ingibiorg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingibiorg_Finnsdottir), a daughter of [Finn Arnesson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Arnesson).[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-31) Although Ingibiorg is generally assumed to have died shortly before 1070, it is possible that she died much earlier, around 1058.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-32) The Orkneyinga Saga records that Malcolm and Ingibiorg had a son, [Duncan II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_II) (Donnchad mac Maíl Coluim), who was later king.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-Orkneyinga_Saga,_c._33-33) Some Medieval commentators, following [William of Malmesbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_of_Malmesbury), claimed that Duncan was illegitimate, but this claim is propaganda reflecting the need of Malcolm's descendants by Margaret to undermine the claims of Duncan's descendants, the [Meic Uilleim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meic_Uilleim).[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-34) Malcolm's son Domnall, whose death is reported in 1085, is not mentioned by the author of the Orkneyinga Saga. He is assumed to have been born to Ingibiorg.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-35)

Malcolm's marriage to Ingibiorg secured him peace in the north and west. The [Heimskringla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heimskringla) tells that her father Finn had been an adviser to [Harald Hardraade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harald_Hardraade) and, after falling out with Harald, was then made an Earl by [Sweyn Estridsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweyn_Estridsson), [King of Denmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Denmark), which may have been another recommendation for the match.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-36) Malcolm enjoyed a peaceful relationship with the [Earldom of Orkney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earldom_of_Orkney), ruled jointly by his stepsons, [Paul and Erlend Thorfinnsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_and_Erlend_Thorfinnsson). The Orkneyinga Saga reports strife with Norway but this is probably misplaced as it associates this with [Magnus Barefoot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Barefoot), who became king of Norway only in 1093, the year of Malcolm's death.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-37)

## Marriage to Margaret

Although he had given sanctuary to [Tostig Godwinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tostig_Godwinson) when the Northumbrians drove him out, Malcolm was not directly involved in the ill-fated invasion of England by Harald Hardraade and Tostig in 1066, which ended in defeat and death at the [battle of Stamford Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Stamford_Bridge).[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-38) In 1068, he granted asylum to a group of English exiles fleeing from [William of Normandy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_of_Normandy), among them [Agatha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agatha,_wife_of_Edward_the_Exile), widow of Edward the Confessor's nephew [Edward the Exile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_the_Exile), and her children: [Edgar Ætheling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_%C3%86theling) and his sisters Margaret and [Cristina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristina,_daughter_of_Edward_the_Exile). They were accompanied by [Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospatric,_Earl_of_Northumbria). The exiles were disappointed, however, if they had expected immediate assistance from the Scots.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-39)

In 1069 the exiles returned to England, to join a spreading revolt in the north. Even though Gospatric and Siward's son [Waltheof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waltheof,_1st_Earl_of_Northampton) submitted by the end of the year, the arrival of a Danish army under Sweyn Estridsson seemed to ensure that William's position remained weak. Malcolm decided on war, and took his army south into [Cumbria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumbria) and across the [Pennines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennines), wasting [Teesdale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teesdale) and [Cleveland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland,_England) then marching north, loaded with loot, to [Wearmouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wearmouth-Jarrow). There Malcolm met Edgar and his family, who were invited to return with him, but did not. As Sweyn had by now been bought off with a large [Danegeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danegeld), Malcolm took his army home. In reprisal, William sent Gospatric to raid Scotland through Cumbria. In return, the Scots fleet raided the Northumbrian coast where Gospatric's possessions were concentrated.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-40) Late in the year, perhaps shipwrecked on their way to a European exile, Edgar and his family again arrived in Scotland, this time to remain. By the end of 1070, Malcolm had married Edgar's sister [Margaret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_of_Wessex) (later known as Saint Margaret).[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-41)

The naming of their children represented a break with the traditional Scots regal names such as Malcolm, Cináed and Áed. The point of naming Margaret's sons—Edward after her father [Edward the Exile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_the_Exile), [Edmund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_of_Scotland) for her grandfather [Edmund Ironside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Ironside), [Ethelred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethelred_of_Scotland) for her great-grandfather [Ethelred the Unready](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethelred_the_Unready) and [Edgar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_of_Scotland) for her great-great-grandfather [Edgar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_I_of_England) and her brother, briefly the elected king, [Edgar Ætheling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_%C3%86theling)—was unlikely to be missed in England, where William of Normandy's grasp on power was far from secure.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-42) Whether the adoption of the classical Alexander for the future [Alexander I of Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_I_of_Scotland) (either for [Pope Alexander II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Alexander_II) or for [Alexander the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great)) and the biblical [David](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David) for the future [David I of Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_I_of_Scotland) represented a recognition that William of Normandy would not be easily removed, or was due to the repetition of Anglo-Saxon royal name—another Edmund had preceded Edgar—is not known.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-43) Margaret also gave Malcolm two daughters, [Edith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edith_of_Scotland), who married [Henry I of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_I_of_England), and Mary, who married [Eustace III of Boulogne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustace_III_of_Boulogne).

In 1072, with the [Harrying of the North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrying_of_the_North) completed and his position again secure, William of Normandy came north with an army and a fleet. Malcolm met William at [Abernethy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abernethy,_Perth_and_Kinross) and, in the words of the [Anglo-Saxon Chronicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle) "became his man" and handed over his eldest son Duncan as a hostage and arranged peace between William and Edgar.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-44) Accepting the overlordship of the king of the English was no novelty, as previous kings had done so without result. The same was true of Malcolm; his agreement with the English king was followed by further raids into Northumbria, which led to further trouble in the earldom and the killing of Bishop [William Walcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Walcher) at [Gateshead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateshead). In 1080, William sent his son [Robert Curthose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Curthose) north with an army while his brother [Odo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odon_of_Conteville) punished the Northumbrians. Malcolm again made peace, and this time kept it for over a decade.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-45)

Malcolm faced little recorded internal opposition, with the exception of Lulach's son [Máel Snechtai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A1el_Snechtai_of_Moray). In an unusual entry, for the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle contains little on Scotland, it says that in 1078:

> Malcholom [Máel Coluim] seized the mother of Mælslæhtan [Máel Snechtai] ... and all his treasures, and his cattle; and he himself escaped with difficulty.[46]

Whatever provoked this strife, Máel Snechtai survived until 1085.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-47)

## Malcolm and William Rufus

![https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/William2.jpg/220px-William2.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/William2.jpg/220px-William2.jpg)

William Rufus, "the Red", king of the English (1087–1100)

When [William Rufus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rufus) became king of England after his father's death, Malcolm did not intervene in the rebellions by supporters of Robert Curthose which followed. In 1091, William Rufus confiscated Edgar Ætheling's lands in England, and Edgar fled north to Scotland. In May, Malcolm marched south, not to raid and take slaves and plunder, but to besiege [Newcastle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne), built by Robert Curthose in 1080. This appears to have been an attempt to advance the frontier south from the [River Tweed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Tweed) to the [River Tees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Tees). The threat was enough to bring the English king back from [Normandy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy), where he had been fighting Robert Curthose. In September, learning of William Rufus's approaching army, Malcolm withdrew north and the English followed. Unlike in 1072, Malcolm was prepared to fight, but a peace was arranged by Edgar Ætheling and Robert Curthose whereby Malcolm again acknowledged the overlordship of the English king.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-48)

In 1092, the peace began to break down. Based on the idea that the Scots controlled much of modern [Cumbria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumbria), it had been supposed that William Rufus's new [castle at Carlisle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlisle_Castle) and his settlement of English peasants in the surrounds was the cause. It is unlikely that Malcolm controlled Cumbria, and the dispute instead concerned the estates granted to Malcolm by William Rufus's father in 1072 for his maintenance when visiting England. Malcolm sent messengers to discuss the question and William Rufus agreed to a meeting. Malcolm travelled south to [Gloucester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloucester), stopping at [Wilton Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilton_Abbey) to visit his daughter Edith and sister-in-law Cristina. Malcolm arrived there on 24 August 1093 to find that William Rufus refused to negotiate, insisting that the dispute be judged by the English barons. This Malcolm refused to accept, and returned immediately to Scotland.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-49)

It does not appear that William Rufus intended to provoke a war,[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-50) but, as the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reports, war came:

> For this reason therefore they parted with great dissatisfaction, and the King Malcolm returned to Scotland. And soon after he came home, he gathered his army, and came harrowing into England with more hostility than behoved him ....[51]

Malcolm was accompanied by Edward, his eldest son by Margaret and probable heir-designate (or tánaiste), and by Edgar.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-52) Even by the standards of the time, the ravaging of Northumbria by the Scots was seen as harsh.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-53)

Memorial cross said to mark the spot where King Malcolm III of Scotland was killed while besieging Alnwick Castle in 1093.

While marching north again, Malcolm was ambushed by [Robert de Mowbray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_de_Mowbray), Earl of Northumbria, whose lands he had devastated, near [Alnwick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alnwick) on 13 November 1093. There he was killed by Arkil Morel, steward of [Bamburgh Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamburgh_Castle). The conflict became known as the [Battle of Alnwick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Alnwick_(1093)).[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-54)[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-55) Edward was mortally wounded in the same fight. Margaret, it is said, died soon after receiving the news of their deaths from Edgar.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-56) The Annals of Ulster say:

> Mael Coluim son of Donnchad, over-king of Scotland, and Edward his son, were killed by the French [i.e. Normans] in Inber Alda in England. His queen, Margaret, moreover, died of sorrow for him within nine days.[57]

Malcolm's body was taken to [Tynemouth Priory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tynemouth_Priory) for burial. The king's body was sent north for reburial, in the reign of his son Alexander, at [Dunfermline Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunfermline_Abbey), or possibly [Iona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iona).[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-58)

On 19 June 1250, following the [canonisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonisation) of Malcolm's wife Margaret by [Pope Innocent IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Innocent_IV), Margaret's remains were disinterred and placed in a reliquary. Tradition has it that as the reliquary was carried to the high altar of [Dunfermline Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunfermline_Abbey), past Malcolm's grave, it became too heavy to move. As a result, Malcolm's remains were also disinterred, and buried next to Margaret beside the altar.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-59)

Fanciful engraving of Malcolm c. 1725

Malcolm appears in [William Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare)’s [Macbeth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbeth) as [Malcolm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_(Macbeth)). He is the son of [King Duncan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Duncan) and heir to the throne. He first appears in the second scene where he is talking to a sergeant, with [Duncan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Duncan). The sergeant tells them how the battle was won thanks to [Macbeth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbeth_(character)). Then Ross comes and Duncan decides that Macbeth should take the title of Thane of Cawdor. Then he later appears in Act 1.4 talking about the execution of the former Thane of Cawdor. Macbeth then enters and they congratulate him on his victory. He later appears in Macbeth's castle as a guest. When his father is killed he is suspected of the murder so he escapes to England. He later makes an appearance in Act 4.3, where he talks to [Macduff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macduff_(Macbeth)) about Macbeth and what to do. They both decide to start a war against him. In Act 5.4 he is seen in Dunsinane getting ready for war. He orders the troops to hide behind branches and slowly advance towards the castle. In Act 5.8 he watches the battle against Macbeth and Macduff with Siward and Ross. When eventually Macbeth is killed, Malcolm takes over as king.

The married life of Malcolm III and Margaret has been the subject of three historical novels: A Goodly Pearl (1905) by Mary H. Debenham, and Malcolm Canmore's Pearl (1907) by Agnes Grant Hay, and Sing, Morning Star by Jane Oliver (1949). They focus on court life in [Dunfermline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunfermline), and the Margaret helping introduce Anglo-Saxon culture in Scotland. The latter two novels cover events to 1093, ending with Malcolm's death.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-Baker-61)[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_note-Nield-62) Malcolm's conflict with William the Conqueror is depicted in the screenplay, Malcolm Son of Duncan, by Laura Ballou which is part of the reading reference library at the Clan Donnachaidh Society Center in Perthshire, Scotland.[[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)]

## Notes

**[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_ref-1)** Magnusson, p. 61**[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_ref-2)** Burton, Vol. 1, p. 350, states: "Malcolm the son of Duncan is known as Malcolm III, but still better perhaps by his characteristic name of Canmore, said to come from the Celtic 'Cenn Mór', meaning 'great chief'". It has also been argued recently that the real "Malcolm Canmore" was this Malcolm's great-grandson [Malcolm IV of Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_IV_of_Scotland), who is given this name in the contemporary notice of his death. Duncan, pp. 51–2, 74–5; Oram, p. 17, note 1.**[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_ref-3)** The question of the name of his family is open. "[House of Dunkeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Dunkeld)" is all but unknown; "Canmore kings" and "Canmore dynasty" are not universally accepted, nor are [Richard Oram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Oram)'s recent "meic Maíl Coluim" or Michael Lynch's "MacMalcolm". For discussions and examples: Duncan, pp. 53–4; McDonald, Outlaws, p. 3; Barrow, Kingship and Unity, Appendix C; Reid Broun discusses the question of identity at length.**[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III,_King_of_Scotland#cite_ref-4)** Hammond, p. 21.
