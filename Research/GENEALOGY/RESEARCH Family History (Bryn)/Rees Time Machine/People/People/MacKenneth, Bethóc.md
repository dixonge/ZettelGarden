**Bethóc ingen Maíl Coluim meic Cináeda** was the elder daughter of [Máel Coluim mac Cináeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_II_of_Scotland), [King of Scots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Scots), and the mother of his successor, [Duncan I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_I_of_Scotland).

## Biography

Bethóc was the eldest daughter of Malcolm II of Scotland, who had no known surviving sons. She married [Crínán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%ADn%C3%A1n_of_Dunkeld), Abbot of Dunkeld. Their older son, [Donnchad I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_I_of_Scotland), ascended to the throne of Scotland around 1034. Malcolm's youngest daughter married [Sigurd Hlodvirsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigurd_the_Stout), Earl of Orkney.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beth%C3%B3c#cite_note-Knox-1) Early writers have asserted that Máel Coluim also designated Donnchad as his successor under the rules of [tanistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanistry) because there were other possible claimants to the throne.

In this period, the Scottish throne still passed in Picto-Gaelic matrilineal fashion, from brother to brother, uncle to nephew, and cousin to cousin.
