# Alpín mac Echdach

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

**Alpín mac Skondre** was a supposed [king of Dál Riata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_D%C3%A1l_Riata), an ancient kingdom that included parts of Ireland and Scotland.

Alpín was included in a [pedigree chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedigree_chart) created in the 10th century to connect the kings of [Alba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alba) (Scotland) to legendary [Dál Skondren](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=D%C3%A1l_Skondre&action=edit&redlink=1) and Irish ancestors. In this pedigree, Alpín's father is [Eochaid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eochaid), an Irish name, yet he becomes the father of Cináed ([Kenneth I of Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_I_of_Scotland)) and [Domnall mac Ailpín](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domnall_mac_Ailp%C3%ADn).

[Cináed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciniod_I) and [Alpín](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alp%C3%ADn_II_of_the_Picts) are the names of [Pictish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictish) kings in the 8th century: the brothers Ciniod and Elphin who ruled from 763 to 780. Alpín's alleged father [Eochaid IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eochaid_mac_%C3%81eda_Find) is not mentioned in any contemporary source.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alp%C3%ADn_mac_Echdach#cite_note-1)

[Weir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alison_Weir) states that Alpín succeeded his father [Eochaid IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eochaid_mac_%C3%81eda_Find) as King 'of Scotland' ([Dál Riata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A1l_Riata)), and also became **King of [Kintyre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintyre)** in March/August 834,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alp%C3%ADn_mac_Echdach#cite_note-:0-2) thus establishing his power over a wide area of Scotland.

## Parentage and death

The Chronicle of the Scottish historian [John of Fordun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_Fordun) records the succession of "Alpin the son of Achay" in 831, his reign of three years, and his defeat by the Picts "20 July".[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alp%C3%ADn_mac_Echdach#cite_note-3) The 12th century [Cronica Regum Scottorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cronica_Regum_Scottorum&action=edit&redlink=1) lists "Alpin filius Eochal venenosi iii, Kynedus filius Alpini primus rex Scottorum xvi…" as kings, dated to the [9th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9th_century).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alp%C3%ADn_mac_Echdach#cite_note-4) Alpín's parentage is not stated in any of the earlier chronicles.

Alpín's mother was the sister and heiress of [Causantín mac Fergusa, King of the Picts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causant%C3%ADn_mac_Fergusa).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alp%C3%ADn_mac_Echdach#cite_note-:0-2) Alpín married a 'Scottish Princess', and fathered two sons.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alp%C3%ADn_mac_Echdach#cite_note-:0-2)

Alpín is chiefly remembered for his fatal war with the [Picts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picts), who had seized upon and arrogated the Kingdom. Alpín resolved to remove the king, and met him with his forces near a village of [Angus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus,_Scotland), where the fight was maintained with great obstinacy, till the Pictish king was slain, whereby the Scots got the victory. However, a new king of "high descent and noble achievements" (possibly [Drest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drest_IX)) was elected king of the Picts, and turned the scale, and at [Galloway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galloway) defeated and took King Alpín, anno 834, and put him with many of his nobles to death. It is said that Alpín's head was fastened to a pole, and carried about the Pictish army, and at last set up for spectacle in [Abernethy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abernethy,_Perth_and_Kinross), their chief town, which was afterwards severely revenged by the Scots, who called the place where he was slain Bas Alpin.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alp%C3%ADn_mac_Echdach#cite_note-5)

Alpín mac Skondre died on 20 July or in August 834 when he was either killed whilst fighting the [Picts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picts) in [Galloway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galloway) or beheaded after the battle.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alp%C3%ADn_mac_Echdach#cite_note-6) His place of burial is not recorded. He was succeeded by his son [Kenneth MacAlpin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_I_of_Scotland).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alp%C3%ADn_mac_Echdach#cite_note-:0-2)
