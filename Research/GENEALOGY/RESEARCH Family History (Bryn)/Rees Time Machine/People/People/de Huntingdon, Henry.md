**Henry of Scotland** (Eanric mac Dabíd, 1114 – 12 June 1152[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_of_Scotland,_3rd_Earl_of_Huntingdon#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOram2011372-1)) was heir apparent to the [Kingdom of Alba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Alba). He was also the 3rd [Earl of Northumberland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_of_Northumbria) and the 3rd [Earl of Huntingdon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_of_Huntingdon). He was the son of King [David I of Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_I_of_Scotland) and Queen [Maud, 2nd Countess of Huntingdon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maud,_2nd_Countess_of_Huntingdon).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_of_Scotland,_3rd_Earl_of_Huntingdon#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOram2011iii-2)

## Earldom

[David I of Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_I_of_Scotland), Henry's father, invaded England in 1136. His army was met by [Stephen of Blois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_of_Blois) at [Carlisle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlisle,_Cumbria). Instead of battle, there was a negotiated settlement that included Henry performing homage to Stephen for Carlisle and the Earldom of Huntingdon.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_of_Scotland,_3rd_Earl_of_Huntingdon#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOram201190-3) Henry's journey to Stephen's court for Easter (1136) was met with resentment, including an accusation of treason,[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_of_Scotland,_3rd_Earl_of_Huntingdon#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOram201191-4) which brought about his return at his father's insistence.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_of_Scotland,_3rd_Earl_of_Huntingdon#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOram201191-4)

After another invasion by his father, Henry was finally invested with the Earldom of Northumberland in 1139.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_of_Scotland,_3rd_Earl_of_Huntingdon#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOram201195-5) Later in the year, Henry met with Stephen at Nottingham, where he was also reinvested with Carlisle and Cumberland.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_of_Scotland,_3rd_Earl_of_Huntingdon#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOram201195-5) Henry then paid homage to Stephen for his earldom.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_of_Scotland,_3rd_Earl_of_Huntingdon#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOram201195-5)

Henry's inclusion into King Stephen's inner circle was highlighted by his arranged marriage to [Ada de Warenne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_de_Warenne).[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_of_Scotland,_3rd_Earl_of_Huntingdon#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOram201196-6) This marriage secured Henry's place within Stephen's kingdom.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_of_Scotland,_3rd_Earl_of_Huntingdon#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOram201196-6) Following [Stephen's capture by forces of Empress Matilda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anarchy), Henry held the Earldom of Northumberland as a Scottish fief.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_of_Scotland,_3rd_Earl_of_Huntingdon#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOram201199-7)

Earl Henry, as sometimes named, son and heir of King [David I of Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_I_of_Scotland), had been in poor health throughout the 1140s. He died suddenly on 12 June 1152. His death occurred in either [Newcastle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle-on-Tyne) or [Roxburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxburgh), both located in those areas of [Northumbria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northumbria) which he and his father had attached to the Scots crown in the period of English weakness after the death of [Henry I of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_I_of_England). Unlike in the case of the English king, who had been left without legitimate male descendants in the wreck of the [White Ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Ship), there was no succession crisis. This was because Earl Henry had left behind three sons to carry forward the lineage of his father.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_of_Scotland,_3rd_Earl_of_Huntingdon#cite_note-8)

On Henry's death, the Huntingdon earldom passed to his half-brother [Simon II de Senlis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_II_de_Senlis).

## Family

In 1139, Henry married [Ada de Warenne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_de_Warenne),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_of_Scotland,_3rd_Earl_of_Huntingdon#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOram2011372-1) the daughter of [William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_de_Warenne,_2nd_Earl_of_Surrey) (died 1138), and [Elizabeth of Vermandois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_of_Vermandois,_Countess_of_Leicester), daughter of [Hugh of Vermandois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_I,_Count_of_Vermandois).
