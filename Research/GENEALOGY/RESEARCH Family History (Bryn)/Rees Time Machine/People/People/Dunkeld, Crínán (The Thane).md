**Crínán of Dunkeld** (died 1045) was the hereditary [abbot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbot) of the monastery of [Dunkeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunkeld), and perhaps the [Mormaer of Atholl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormaer_of_Atholl). Crínán was progenitor of the [House of Dunkeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Dunkeld), the dynasty which would rule Scotland until the later 13th century. He was the son-in-law of one king, and the father of another.

## Family

Crínán was married to [Bethóc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beth%C3%B3c), daughter of [Máel Coluim mac Cináeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_II_of_Scotland) (Malcolm II) ([King of Scots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Scots), who reigned from 1005 to 1034). As Máel Coluim had no surviving son, the strongest hereditary claim to the Scottish throne descended through Bethóc. Crínán and Bethóc's eldest son, [Donnchad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donnchad_I_of_Scotland) (Duncan I),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%ADn%C3%A1n_of_Dunkeld#cite_note-1) who reigned from 1034 to 1040.

The Carlyle family claimed as their ancestor Crínán's alleged second son Maldred, father of [Gospatric of Northumbria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospatric,_Earl_of_Northumbria). However, G. W. S. Barrow argued that the idea of Maldred being the son of Crínán was based on a mistake on the part of historian [W. F. Skene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Forbes_Skene).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%ADn%C3%A1n_of_Dunkeld#cite_note-2)

## Abbot of Dunkeld

The [monastery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastery) of [Saint Columba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columba) was founded on the north bank of the [River Tay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Tay) in the 6th century or early 7th century following the expedition of Columba into the land of the [Picts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picts). It may have continued to draw its hierarchy from the [Cenél Conaill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cen%C3%A9l_Conaill) of Donegal.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%ADn%C3%A1n_of_Dunkeld#cite_note-3) [Iain Moncreiffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_Moncreiffe) argued that Crinán belonged to a Scottish sept of the Irish [Cenél Conaill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cen%C3%A9l_Conaill) royal dynasty.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%ADn%C3%A1n_of_Dunkeld#cite_note-4) Alternatively, Christopher Cairney proposed a [Cenél nEógain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cen%C3%A9l_nE%C3%B3gain) descent for the House of Dunkeld.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%ADn%C3%A1n_of_Dunkeld#cite_note-5)

While the title of Hereditary Abbot (coarb in Gaelic) was a [feudal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feudal) position that was often exercised in name only, Crinán does seem to have acted as Abbot in charge of the monastery in his time. He was thus a man of high position in both clerical and secular society.

The magnificent semi-ruined [Dunkeld Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunkeld_Cathedral), built in stages between 1260 and 1501, stands today on the grounds once occupied by the monastery. The Cathedral contains the only surviving remains of the previous monastic society: a course of red stone visible in the east [choir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choir) wall that may have been re-used from an earlier building, and two stone ninth - or tenth-century cross-slabs in the Cathedral Museum.

In 1045, Crínán of Dunkeld rose in rebellion against [Macbeth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbeth,_King_of_Scotland) in support of his 14-year-old grandson, [Malcolm III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_III_of_Scotland)'s claim to the throne.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%ADn%C3%A1n_of_Dunkeld#cite_note-Knox-6) Malcolm was the elder son of Crinan's son, the late King Duncan, who predeceased his father. However, Crínán, by then an elderly man, was killed in a battle at Dunkeld.
