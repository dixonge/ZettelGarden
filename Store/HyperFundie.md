- ADHD 101

    ```markdown
    I remember the cover of the book. It did what all good book covers aspire to do, it got my attention. The cover was a photo of a grimacing young boy tightly squinching his eyes shut. The title was “Look Me In The Eye: My Life With Asperger’s” and a quick perusal of the jacket liner and first chapter rang a bit too familiar.

    You’ve seen the comedy bits where someone is talking with a person who has a large mole on their face (or some other unusual characteristic) and the more they try to not stare at it or say something inappropriate, the more they fail? It’s funny in comedy. But in real life it would not be. My problem seems to be the opposite. I struggle to look at you when talking to you. I know I shouldn’t look elsewhere, that people might think it odd, or rude, but it’s very difficult for me.

    This behavior exasperates my wife. After interactions with store clerks or waiters she asks “Why don’t you look at people when you talk to them?” and I just wonder why she keeps making such ridiculous assertions! For the longest time I was quite sure that I only looked away to point at something, or if I were thinking about something — all normal behavior, I assured her. But she remembered the time a store clerk actually leaned over to attempt to get back into my field of vision. I don’t remember that incident, but I began to make an extra effort to fix my gaze on people when talking with them.

    And now this book had given me a clue as to why I might be doing this. When I got home I began to research the symptoms of Asperger’s, but quickly discovered that the *only* symptom that seemed to match was the one about eye contact. However, I did find something else, something which was also on the so-called ‘Autism Spectrum’ that rang truer. As I explored the symptoms and took some online tests and ran these same items by my wife, we both agreed. I had ADHD, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.

    A period of intense research began. I hyper-focused on it, which is actually a hallmark of ADHD. I felt that I had a ‘mild’ case, as I normally don’t bounce off the walls or fidget. Most people wouldn’t notice, except maybe the eye thing. But social interaction issues that had been a problem for a long time suddenly had an explanation that didn’t involve blame or shame. Maybe I don’t dominate conversations just because I’m a narcissistic asshole! I often joked that I did so because I knew I was smarter and more interesting than everyone else, but I truly struggled to hit the brakes, even after that gentle squeeze, nudge or kick from the wife. And when someone else is talking, my mind is racing to think of similar stories, ready to fill any void with more words.

    But there is one way to shut me up: scold me for my behavior. My wife has done so on several occasions, and my response is to clam up and say nothing for an extended period. Yes, very childish, I know. But there is no graduated dial here, just an on/off switch, and it’s rarely off. With my eye contact issue, I tend to just think that it’s more rare than it is, or that people don’t really notice that much, therefore I don’t have the same response as I do with the talking issue. When it comes to dominating conversations, I am sometimes aware that I’m doing it. I guess what must really frustrate people is to have me not only talk too much, but not look at them while doing it!

    There are many other quirks and mental processes I can now understand so much better, all attributable to ADHD. The lifelong attraction to stimulants, for example. But the aspect that most caught my attention was impulsivity. That one thing felt like it might hold the key to so many choices I had made which seemed to defy all reason and logic. 

    I found a list of examples of impulsivity. Here are the ones I have definitely struggled with at some point:

    * Punching something or being verbally aggressive
    * Stealing
    * Running away
    * Spending more money than you have (going in debt)
    * Unprotected sex, acting out sexually
    * Drug use
    * Being dishonest
    * Breaking the rules
    * Drinking alcohol
    * Driving under the influence of an illegal substance or getting into a car with irresponsible peers
    * Tantrums (slamming doors, throwing things, hitting walls
    * Destroying property when angry
    * Smoking cigarettes
    * Overeating
    * Driving without a license

- I Blame Me

    ```markdown
    You could play almost any rock or motown song from the 70's and I could probably hum or sing along to the guitar solo, note for note, or air drum every cymbal crash. The rhythms and notes are seemingly etched into my brain. But when I attempt to recall a conversation or a person's name, even from a much more recent time, it is as if my memory is full of holes.

    I do, however, remember the conversation I was having with my pregnant wife right before I abandoned her and our children. It was the most normal conversation in the world. I told her about having a temporary office job lined up for the next day and she told me she was getting ready to leave work and come home. When the conversation ended, a thought popped into my head. It was a random thought, the kind you almost always dismiss with a laugh. I mean, it's one thing to think 'I wonder what would happen if I stuck this knife into that electrical outlet' but it's quite a different thing to actually do so! But some of us can't seem to stop at the thought. Some of us require that jolt of electricity, all 120 volts of it, to seize our arm and violently jerk us around like a rag doll before we realize that some thoughts should not be acted on. You should not swerve into the orange barrels full of sand while driving 75mph down the freeway. You should not jump off the fence to break your arm in order to get out of school, no matter how much cardboard you've laid on the ground as a pad. You should not drop lit matches into the hay in the mayor's back yard. You should not use the women's restroom at church camp, because what if you accidentally dropped your wallet in there?

    And let's add one more to that list. You should not jump on your motorcycle and disappear without a trace, no matter how much of an adrenaline rush you might experience, just because a thought popped into your head. Yes, even if that thought was "If you're going to leave, you have to do it now!" Even if that thought seemed to come out of nowhere. Maybe it was the devil, most likely it was not God, but maybe it was just a random firing of a random neuron. Or maybe it was something from your subconscious mind trying to express a feeling of being trapped, or being overwhelmed by responsibility, or just being bored. Having an irresponsible thought pop into your head doesn't make you irresponsible, but if you act on it that's exactly how everyone will see you. Because we tend to judge others by their actions, but judge ourselves by our intentions.

    And this is a big problem for me when I look back over my life. How can I judge my past self if I can't be sure what my intentions were? Was I simply selfishly running away from the responsibilities of life? Was I just too young to be a responsible father? Was I just ill-equipped to deal with a wife who sometimes snapped and yelled for seemingly insignificant reasons? I don't remember *having* an *intention* about pretty much anything. I was, for all intents and purposes, intentionless.

    Which leaves actions. And if I judge my past self by my actions, then I stand accused of many things: idiocy, impulsivity, naivety, cowardice, gross neglect, abandonment, callousness. And not just accused, guilty as charged. I plead no contest.

    A big part of the reason I began exploring the idea of writing about my life was a desire to discover why I did what I did. It would be helpful if I could simply find something or someone else to blame, a scapegoat. The easiest target is my first wife. She certainly had a major role in all of this. She, in turn, could probably blame her parents, either the ones who gave her up for adoption, or the ones who raised her. Or I could blame my fundamentalist childhood, or my ADHD. But while those are all factors, I can't say that any of them are insurmountable, especially given the number of people who have overcome far worse to lead healthy, responsible lives.

    I blame me.

    In writing about my past I initially conflated two questions. I wanted to answer the question of why -- why did I do those stupid things? Along the way, I began to also think about who was to blame. Readers will know if you aren't honest about yourself, if you try to avoid a good amount of truthful introspection. That's what I am told. That's what many memoir coaches say. I think I've got that part covered. Of course, it's rarely just one thing or one person at fault. Life is more complicated than that. But accepting blame is a good first step. That part came easy. I blame me.

    But in the end, it's really not about blame. It's about
    ```

- No Pasarán!

    ```markdown
    Compared to most people, I have always been fortunate in that I have maintained a decent relationship with my parents through to adulthood. If you are over fifty and still talk to and see your parents on a regular basis, you're probably in the minority. But I'm just guessing on that -- I have no stats to back up that opinion.

    Up until I was 42 or so my relationship with my parents was helped along by our shared Christianity. But once I became an atheist, things began to shift. For the first few years I pretended that nothing had changed. But then my Dad discovered a blog post I had written and that's when things got dicey. To his credit, he never broke off contact with me, although you can certainly find plenty of Bible verses that would proscribe that I should have been cut off or cast out. He did not, and I admire him for that. But it was definitely a strain. He had always maintained the idea that I would someday, somehow be involved in church leadership. Right before I deconverted I was, in fact, the praise and worship leader for a medium-sized Charismatic church for five years. That was as close as I got. Now he was left knowing that I would never want to inherit his collection of books and Bible commentaries. He was also saddened that I would now see his life as a waste. My view on the validity of pastoral work was definitely much reduced, but I still admire the many wonderful things he has done. When a loved one is rushed to the hospital in the middle of the night, he was often called in and arrived before some of the family did. He comforted them. They leaned on his shoulder and on his presence. They truly relied on his words and prayers to keep them from falling apart. Many times this continued right on through to death and funeral arrangements and the final services and burial. On the flip side of that were the many marriage services he performed. All of these major life events and he was invited into the middle of them. His presence was integral, and it has bonded him with families all over Texas for as long as I have been alive, over a half-century.

    It is true that I now give him less credit for the theological aspects of his education, or the sermons he has preached or bible studies he has taught. I'm sure that bothers him, but I hope it is somewhat offset by the rest.

    After becoming atheist, I began to re-evaluate a lot of things. My politics changed slowly. By 2008 I stopped voting for Republicans. Later I stopped rooting for the Dallas Cowboys, then quit watching football altogether. To top things off, at the beginning of 2016 the wife and I stopped eating meat and dairy products. We went from fundie right-wing steak-eaters to atheist left-wing radical vegans!

    Still, I was in touch with my parents and my brother on a fairly regular basis. It was all good until Trump came along and fucked it all up!

    Fucking Trump. Seriously. I would have been perfectly happy to not vote in the 2016 election but once he became the official GOP nominee I was forced to make a choice. Now it was about more than just platforms and theory. This guy was saying some pretty disturbing shit! Worse, his rhetoric legitimized every racist, xenophobic Nazi in the country. They were coming out of the woodwork, and they had close ties to people at the top of his campaign. Just his campaign was threatening my LGBT and non-white friends. So I was forced to hold my nose and vote for Hillary.

    And then the unthinkable happened. Holy shit. WTF? Our votes were some of the 2.8 million that didn't actually count for anything. The electoral college is all-or-nothing in Texas and many other states, so our votes are completely unrepresented in the electoral college. So much for 'representative' democracy.

    It all came to a head around Thanksgiving. The Sunday before I had just finished ten days of thinking and reading and trying to wrap my head around a Trump presidency. In those ten days, our worst fears were being realized. For every area where Trump indicated a slight easing up, he would double down on two other areas. During this time I actually deactivated my Facebook account for a few weeks. It was just too much. But I am part of a group that utilizes Facebook almost exclusively for communication, so I signed back in. Still, I could feel my blood pressure rising. So I hatched a plan.

    First, I blocked the few remaining people on my friend list that were probably Trump voters. Those turned out to be almost all family. Second, I emailed my Dad and brother and told them that I was getting off of Facebook. That way they wouldn't realize that I had blocked them when they discovered that my FB account was gone. Problem solved. Now I could avoid Trump crap and I could also post anything I wanted about Trump without worrying that it would offend them, or that they would respond and stir shit up on my feed. Problem solved!

    One problem remained. We were four days out from showing up at a family Thanksgiving dinner. It was starting to sound like a nightmare. First, the meal was at my sister-in-law's parents' house. Total in attendance estimated to be around forty people. Second, her father and my brother were big hunting buddies. Third, most of these people are good old god-fearin' Christians. Fourth, as one might expect, the main dishes would include either meat or dairy products or both. And now, on top of all that, we would be forced to deal with squeezing in our few vegan dishes and hoping to escape without talking about religion or hunting or our new glorious leader Trump. It was just too much!

    So we talked it out and I sent an email and told my family we wouldn't be able to make it this year. At first it seemed as if we might have hurt my Dad's feelings, but when I called to wish him happy birthday there was no indication of that. We had a good chat.

    Still. There was an elephant in the room. There were reasons behind our decision that I didn't want to voice. The fact is, we are having a very difficult time squaring the family that we know to be generally good and kind people and the incredible vile hatred that is Trump. How could nice people vote for someone as spiteful and mean and, yes, nasty as Trump? A lot of my recent Google searches were an attempt to answer this question. I think I have found some answers, but it isn't pretty.

    One question dealt with religion - how could Christians vote for someone as non-religious as Trump? 80% of evangelical christians did so. The answer is that their true religion is and always has been conservatism, not christianity. Another question I had was how people managed to get past some of the evil things he had said towards women and minorities. Some, as Josh Strawn put it, are "...politically motivated bigots who are cultivating genuine political power in the name of hateful authoritarianism. And, if they aren’t bigots (some surely aren’t), they are far too content to travel among those who are."[^1]

    A lot of this comes in the form of confirmation bias and reinterpretation. Strawn, again, says "A presidential candidate can say something outlandish and cruel, and the candidate’s words will be immediately fitted to the voter’s desired understanding." I've noticed this same pattern throughout the history of Christianity. Christians used to use Scripture to justify slavery. Later they used it to justify racial purity and to prohibit inter-racial marriage. Now many churches have embraced even gay marriage! Same Bible, same church, different interpretation, fitted to the current moral understanding. According to Strawn, Trump's supporters reinterpret his statements as "sarcasm, innocuous misspeaking, or the political equivalent of shock rock."[^2]

    So that helps to understand the motivation a bit, but it certainly doesn't get rid of the problem that is Trump.

- Structure/Theme Notes

    ### Working Idea for Book Structure

    Combine first two book ideas (in following note) with ADHD.

    Unseen Enemies

    How to structure theme/argument when the answer/revelation about both unseen enemies didn't occur until mid-to-late 40's? Easy to find a certain number of events to illustrate each major problem (fundamentalism/ADHD) but does that answer 'theme' issue? My response at the time was simply to bumble and stumble and somehow survive, all the while being *completely unaware* that the problems were:

    1 - Fundamentalism, which, even if I had known it, I would never have thought of as a problem to begin with.
    2 - ADHD - Something most people had never heard of then, and medicine was not even available for.

    How do you work *that* into the typical memoir structure/flow?

    Idea: two climaxes (end of first marriage, then later being held at gunpoint) - resolution of this period of my life, without knowing the end
     - possible epilogue of contact from Anna?

Looking back at all the burned bridges and abandoned lives, I wondered what would cause someone to make so many bad choices? I blame myself, but what if my childhood fundamentalist Christian indoctrination had destined me to fail? Was it my black and white, all-or-nothing programming that caused so much trouble? Would I have to leave religion behind in order to overcome my past?

        ```markdown
        The one thing I have done so far in my life that might possibly be considered a claim to fame is a very brief stint as the boyfriend of a TV sitcom star.  If you watched TV in the late 70's and early 80's you probably saw my ex-girlfriend. I always got a kick out of watching that show because the character she was playing was pretty much the exact opposite of the way she was in real life, back when we were in love.

        Lisa's family attended First Baptist Church in Lake Worth where my dad was pastor.  Her dad drove the church bus most Sunday mornings during this time and I was often coerced into riding along, an effort to boost the numbers a bit, I suspect.  When Lisa rode along she often helped lead the main body of passengers (neighborhood children) in singing, or she would entertain them with a bit of ventriloquism.  She honed her skills on the bus and I later saw her put on a very nice ventriloquism performance in a school talent show.  Other than that I rarely saw her at school as I was a couple of years ahead of her.  A CCM Magazine interview with her mentions the following which I originally assumed was a reference to myself:

        "While the other kids were having food fights in the cafeteria, she and her only friend, the preacher's son, were off in a corner studying."

        As it turns out she was referring to someone else, but for years I thought that it was me and that I had just forgotten these study sessions.  I gave her memory the benefit of the doubt, however, since I also don't recall a brief 'love affair' with Ruthie Martin in the 7th Grade, but Ruthie remembered it enough to bring it up in front of the entire group of attendees at my high school's 20th reunion!  Trust me, when a woman stands up in front of a group of people and asks you if you remember being in love twenty-five years ago there is only one correct answer, and it doesn't involve shrugging your shoulders and looking like an amnesia victim!

        What I *do* recall is the brief period of time when Lisa and I were 'going steady.'  I believe it lasted all of two weeks, and the timeframe is a bit difficult to narrow down.  I sporadically kept a diary from February, 1973 to October, 1975, covering 6th through 8th grades and our move from sleepy west Texas to the big city.  Most of the entries appear to mark either the beginning or ending of a romantic relationship and I can hardly read them now without laughing out loud!  On December 7, 1974 I wrote the following:

        "I have since left Karen and have gone on to other girls.  For instance, Regina and Sharon.  But now I'm having a problem making up my mind.  Lisa Whelchel or Kelli?  I think Kelli likes another boy, but I don't know if Lisa has a boyfriend or not.  I hope not!"

        On the 11th I noted, "Lisa doesn't seem to notice me."  And on March 3, 1975 I made the following mature observation:

        "I seem to be doing pretty good with Lisa Whelchel.  Yesterday, in Training Union, she and another girl came in from another class.  I made the usual funny jokes.  But today in school she told me "Hi!"!  That's a switch.  I hope to really get something going with her!"

        I hope you are getting as much laughter out of this as I do.

        My diary somehow failed to record the 'climax' of this torrid affair which occurred on the night my family went to her house, for dinner I believe.  The grown-ups talked and drank coffee in the kitchen and Cody did what all little brothers are supposed to do and pestered us.  As crazy as it sounds I only remember two things about that evening.  One thing is how embarrassed she became when Cody found a pair of her panty hose lying around somewhere and thought it would be great fun to show them to me.  The other thing is the odd way we walked around the house together....instead of holding hands we somehow ended up with her holding on to my thumb.  It felt awkward but I was so excited that she was touching me at all I couldn't figure out how to adjust!

        The next diary entry that mentions her was on September 6, 1975:

        "Things have been going okay lately.  In my love life, I guess I will have to say I'm still hung up on Lisa.  I have started clipping newspaper articles of her and keeping them."

        The rest of that entry goes on to describe all of the other girls that had been grabbing my attention.  (Hey, I was fourteen, what do you expect?)  The newspaper articles in question were related to some of her early beauty pageants and acting roles at the local theater Casa MaÃ±ana.  She was out of town a lot on weekends after that, and before you know it she was living in California with her mom and running around wearing mouse ears as a member of the â€œNew Mouseketeers.â€  That was the break that eventually led to her role on â€œThe Facts of Lifeâ€ where she portrayed Blair Warner for 209 episodes. 

        The last time I saw her was several years later when I was attending college at Dallas Baptist University.  This would have been somewhere between late 1979 and late 1980.  The first season of Facts of Life had already aired.  I was running around helping get things set up for a concert, I think it was either one of the last concerts for a Christian group named Dogwood, or possibly a young Amy Grant.  Lisa and a friend from her church came in and I was pleasantly surprised that she remembered me.  We chatted ever-so-briefly but I had to get back to work and I didn't see her afterwards.  In retrospect I should have hunted her down and tried to catch up on her life, but I didnâ€™t, and so thatâ€™s where this story ends. My 15 minutes of fame was up.

    - My Fundie Hero

        ```markdown
        My problem with the church was never one of theology. Somehow, even as a youth, I was able to distinguish between theology and practice, and it was definitely the practice part I had issues with. The way in which we Southern Baptists practiced our beliefs was mired in tradition. Worship services, Sunday School, Vacation Bible School, Training Union - all of these were scheduled meetings where everything was scripted and rarely deviated. By the time I was getting ready to go to college, I had heard the same sermons and read the same scripture passages so many times I had them memorized. The worst was hymns, most of which were already approaching one hundred years in age, some of which were over five hundred years old. The authors were all dead, and to my ear their hymns had followed suit.

        This is why kids who went to church listened to the same music their non-church schoolmates listened to -- there really wasn't any modern alternative! When so-called 'Jesus music' came along in the early 70's things changed somewhat, but it was extremely difficult to access if you didn't live in California. Up until I graduated from high school, only one radio station in the Dallas area had broadcast any sort of Contemporary Christian Music (CCM) and that only lasted about six months. That was it.

        In the summer after I graduated from high school I attended my final youth retreat with others from First Baptist Lake Worth. I played the piano and sung a song by Tim Sheppard, "Joy In the Morning" and won the talent contest. I ‘rededicated’ my life to the Lord and spent the rest of the summer in a haze of evangelical zeal. I moved to the campus of Dallas Baptist University (DBU) a few weeks before the fall semester opened so that I could earn some ‘work study’ funds and began my life as a young adult.

        I believe it was some time in the spring of 1980 when I was riding in a car with some DBU friends. They were talking over the CCM song coming from the tape player. It was just background music to them, but I asked them to turn it up and heard Keith Green for the first time. The lyrics jolted me:

        The world is sleeping in the dark,
        That the church just can’t fight,
        ‘cause it’s asleep in the light!
        How can you be so dead?!
        When you’ve been so well fed
        Jesus rose from the grave,
        And you!
        You can’t even get out of bed!

        The message and attraction couldn’t have been any clearer. This was an obvious appeal to fundamentalism, and it definitely appealed to me. It was a ‘moth-to-the-flame’ attraction. Keith railed against complacency and how religion had become compromised. This came out in many of his early songs. And not only was he a singer, but he had a ministry. By the time I discovered Keith he had not only released his second album but his ministry headquarters had moved from California to Texas, less than two hours from the college I was attending. I bought a cassette tape or two and practically wore them out. I began receiving his Last Days Newsletter and devoured each issue, each article. I bought his song books and began playing them all on the piano. I was obviously tackling someone with downright virtuoso skills, both vocally and on the keyboard, but I was that drawn to his music.

        Over the next several years this mentality ruled my life. I was zealous, uncompromising, a bit condescending and a general pain in the neck. Woe be unto any one within earshot if the conversation veered into religion. Of course at the time I considered myself a very reasonable person who just happened to be initiated into something that most people were not. I don’t think I made a total ass out of myself but even my dad didn’t pass muster when it came to my new and improved spiritual guidelines. Not even the local churches, including the huge First Baptist Dallas, could satisfy my hunger for uncompromising religion. I usually just played and sang at a piano somewhere on Sunday mornings rather than attend a church. My relationship with Keith was one of deep passion and emotion which I can still feel thirty-five years later any time I hear his music. He was everything I longed to be.

        I spent the summer of 1980 as a staff member of a Baptist ‘encampment’ in the hills above Santa Fe, New Mexico. Glorieta was one of two major places where Baptists spent time during summer vacation. Each week the faithful would come in by the busload and check in to their hotel rooms. Some weeks were for training for Vacation Bible School, others for Sunday School, or music or youth work. As summer staff we received pay that was below minimum wage but included free room and board. While the nation was suffering under an unprecedented heat wave, I was wearing a sweater to work every morning in the cool, crisp mountain air.

        There were three primary musical influences in my life that summer. One was the surprising discovery that Bob Dylan was now a Christian. I later learned that part of what brought this about was some correspondence and conversation between him and Keith Green. The cassette tape I picked up was Dylan’s “Slow Train Coming” which had been released the previous fall. Unlike much of CCM this recording was performed by seasoned music pros and marked a change of heart for one of the premier icons of the rebellious 60’s generation. And I just flat out liked the songs, the beats, the words. It was good stuff. It inspired me.

        Another album was from the old southern gospel group The Imperials. They had a new CCM sound and Russ Taff’s lead vocals were awesome. Probably not a bad song on the whole album. Lots of synthesized strings, smooth mellow vocals, and the lyrics “I stood and watched an eagle fly, spread his wings and soar across the sky, so gracefully he flew…” It was an almost perfect match for the majesty of the mountains.

        And, of course, there was Keith Green. A group of summer staffers went to see him when he did one of his rare concerts that summer down in Albuquerque. His zeal and passion was so intense that it suppressed all possible logical and rational thought and struck as an arrow to the heart, inflaming emotional responses like the best and worst of history’s cult leaders and megalomaniacs. His sincerity and desire to do the right thing was never in question, his belief that he was doing God’s bidding is a given. But it set up a war within my soul, and probably within the souls of many other thousands of youth across the country. He espoused the view that one was called to the mission field by default, and that only upon hearing a definitive opposing calling from the Lord should one do anything else. Like anything theological one can argue both sides of the issue and find plenty of scripture to back up your position, but his message was compelling. Of course most left the auditorium that day and never took any serious action toward becoming a missionary, but that doesn’t mean that the thought leaves the mind. Instead it hangs around the periphery only to pop out with an occasional twang of guilt at appropriate opportunities. Thus, the internal struggle,

        I participated in a musical group which performed several times over the summer. We performed a Christian musical called The Witness which was basically the core gospel message from the viewpoint of Peter and I had one of the lead singing roles. I also sang in the summer staffer talent show, although I don't remember if I did well or not.

        I met Deeanne, my first wife, that summer. She managed to finish her high school degree that fall, a semester early, so she could come attend DBU with me. Shortly after our first semester together started, we made the trip back down to her hometown of Georgetown, Texas and saw Keith Green in concert at the Austin Coliseum. The building was normally used for wrestling events, and they actually used the main wrestling ring for the concert. They reinforced the canvas (with plywood, I presume) and put the baby grand piano inside the ropes. Keith used the rather obvious prop as an analogy to spiritual warfare. “And in this corner, Jeeeee-suuuus Chriiiiiiiist…” As usual, Keith was intense and evangelized as much as he sang. At the end, he had the crowd exit the building in silence and prayer while he continued to speak to those who were committing their lives to Christ, either for the first time, or for the mission field. As we left, we didn't realize it would be the last time we got to see him perform.

        Deeanne and I married that summer and moved into an apartment near campus in Oak Cliff. That fall, I ended up running out of work study money and was forced to withdraw from my classes and work full time. Then we ran into an opportunity to work at a Baptist children's home as dorm parents. The main benefit was that I would be able to go back to college full time during the day when the kids were at school. I was 21. Deeanne was 19.

        The summer of 1982 Deeanne and I visited her parents again in Georgetown. On our way back to Dallas we heard a news break on the radio. A small plane had crashed near Lindale, Texas and it was believed that all on board were dead. Deeanne and I looked at each other. We knew. Keith Green was dead.

        image

        We were stunned. Our only source of information was news from Christian radio stations. The plane was overloaded. There was no other way to look at it. What was difficult was figuring out why God had allowed such a thing to happen. Keith was gone, two of his children were gone. An entire family of eight was gone. And the pilot was gone. But never underestimate the ability of the true believer to find reinforcing answers, no matter how illogical or irrational, to the questions of life. My personal favorite was the idea that perhaps Keith was about to fall into sin and that God had ‘taken him home’ to somehow spare the rest of us from the tragic fallout of such. But most of the answers that were proposed were just looking for a silver lining, some variation on the ‘when life gives you lemons, make lemonade’ line of thinking. Of course this begs the question of why God allowed the lemon in the first place.

        image

        Within a week of his death we received our pre-ordered copy of his new album Songs for the Shepherd. I cried as I listened. The next Saturday we drove to Lindale for the first time and found the Last Days Ministries headquarters. We drove around and found a nearby church and found the gravesite. It still had memorial wreaths from other ministries and organizations and the dirt mound was still there. We ‘paid our respects’ and probably prayed asking God to make us more like Keith.

        Over the next five years Keith was still a part of our lives. His wife and ministry organization set up a memorial tour and later published a biography. New albums and songbooks of previously unreleased music came out, as well as commemorative albums and video. Keith's music was a prominent part of our record collection, and I regularly played and sang his songs on our piano.

        My love for Keith's music survived through my divorce from Deeanne five years later and into my marriage to Dixie. She and I lived and worked in the Dallas area and we attended a Charismatic Nazarene church. While I attempted to turn her on to Keith Green’s music, I’m not sure she ever quite got the attraction. So much of it was tied up into my own youth, my own fundamentalist childhood and memories intertwined with my first marriage that I just don’t think it translated.

        I'm not sure if we were on vacation or if I was currently unemployed, but on a Tuesday in July I decided to take a spontaneous trip to East Texas. As part of the trip, I stopped by Lindale to show Dixie the ministry headquarters founded by my spiritual hero, and to stop by Keith's gravesite.

        As we walked into the church cemetery we saw a woman sitting on a large headstone in the far corner. After wandering around a bit I determined that Keith's grave was actually somewhere near the woman, but out of a sense of respect, we waited. She soon left, and we then made our way to that corner of the cemetery. In fact, we made our way to the very headstone she had been sitting on! I couldn’t believe the timing! What were the odds that I would randomly show up on the same day that Melody Green was visiting the graves of her two children and husband? And then I looked at the headstone: July 28, 1982.

        It was the tenth anniversary of his death.

        My heart sunk! We had chased Keith’s widow away on a day when she should have been able to visit and think and reminisce all she wanted. I felt so bad that when we got back home I promptly emailed Melody to apologize. Surprisingly, she actually responded! She was gracious, and even scolded herself for being out there to begin with. I gave her the benefit of the doubt. It wasn’t a lengthy email exchange back and forth, but I was glad to have been able to apologize and to know that I hadn’t caused any sort of trauma.

        In the final analysis, I loved Keith for all the wrong reasons, and all the right reasons. He was so many things I aspired to be. His tenacity and dedication to perfecting his musical craft was an example, his golden tenor voice was how I sounded in my own head, and his dedication to finding his way to true Christian obedience and perfection was unsurpassed. His personality had always been one of ‘no compromise’ but at the time I was unaware of his history prior to his conversion. I just saw his all-or-nothing approach as closely matching my own fundamentalist mindset. To me he wasn’t just being Keith, he was obeying scripture.

        All of these things were truly the wrong reasons to love him. They are in many ways the worst part of fundamentalist Christianity. Given the plasticity of the Bible, any attempt to take one particular interpretation and turn it into absolute law usually results in disaster, with a pile of bodies in its wake. Keith’s personality combined with fundamentalism often hurt those he loved the most.

        image

        But there was good in there. Keith took concepts to their natural conclusions. Even while rising to stardom within the Christian music world he challenged the validity of the system itself. When he headlined the Jesus Northwest festival in 1978 he was so aware of the hypocrisy that it caused him great distress. He viewed himself as somewhat of a prophet because of such inner dialog. His relief valve was to castigate the 35,000 people in attendance. In effect, they wound up paying money to go to a festival so that the main attraction could chastise them and spew Bible verses at them about how much God hated festivals and songs! This couldn’t have pleased the PR people at Sparrow Records, or the festival sponsors, but it endeared him to the fundies, his core audience.

        He also believed in the Gospel challenges of Jesus to “Go” and followed that line of thinking out to its logical conclusion as well. His entire ministry shifted to one of challenging people to do missions work as the default ‘calling’ of God, unless they heard from Him otherwise. Most of the church viewed things the other way around, with the default position being one of slavish servitude and devotion (and tithing) unless you heard from God otherwise. I still enjoy the general thought of Keith ‘sticking it to the man’ in that way, misdirected and misguided though he may have been.

        I find it interesting that I still have such fond memories of someone who was so rabidly Christian. As an atheist, that is pretty rare. I do, however, have fond memories for different things in my life, as does everyone. It’s just human nature to remember certain places and people and periods with fondness. But when I finally rejected Christianity it obviously affected the possibility of happy reunions. It is difficult to show up to church or Christian-related gatherings when everyone is talking about their wonderful ministry paths. Ending my story with “and then we stopped going to church and became atheists” is quite a show-stopper. True, I have very little in common with those people any more, but that doesn’t mean that I can’t value those times or laugh at shared memories.

        The same holds true for my love of Keith Green. The emotional ties are strong because religion is such an emotional experience, especially the fundamentalist variety. But I would be quickly unwelcome at a “we love Keith Green” event since I no longer share the religious views. But that’s ok with me. I can still admire and respect his talent and brazen audacity from the outside. I no longer worship him in the way I did, and I no longer value any of his ministry goals, but reading about his life can still make me smile and laugh at his antics, and still make me sad and misty-eyed at the way it all ended. Yeah, this atheist still has a very warm place in his heart for one of the most all-out, sold-out Christian music artists of all time.

        In the end, Keith and I were just the proverbial 'ships that pass in the night.' He began life as a secular Jew and ended up as a rabid fundie Christian, while I started life as a rabid fundie Christian and ended up an atheist. Recently I researched the pre-Christian part of Keith's life and found some wonderful things to add to my memories of him and to balance out the zealotry. I was rather surprised to discover that he didn't just appear on the scene in the late 70's out of nowhere, he was a child prodigy. By the time he was eight years old he had been in TV commercials, a TV pilot and 'stole the show' in a play. At 10 he played Kurt von Trapp on stage. At the age of 11 he had written forty original songs and was signed to a five-year contract by Decca Records. When his first single was released he became the youngest member of ASCAP, which flew him to New York. Decca saw him as a teen idol and he appeared on the Jack Benny, Joey Bishop and Steve Allen TV shows and sang with Sammy Davis, Jr., but the teen idol plans never quite panned out. Then Donny Osmond appeared and Keith faded away. Keith ended up composing for CBS with his wife Melody

    - My Perfectly Normal Childhood

        ```markdown
        I've always thought of my childhood as fairly normal. Recently, this idea was given a rather skeptical reception, so I decided it might be a good idea to revisit my past and see if I can muster a defense of my assertion. So I'll start off like a debate.

        My assertion: My childhood was pretty normal

        Opposition assertion: After we've heard all of these crazy things you've done, there's *no way* you had a normal childhood.

        Fair enough, I can see how it would look that way. Still, to be thorough, let's proceed to the arguments.

        I see the following things as good arguments on the side of normalcy. My parents overcame adverse childhoods and managed to have and raise me without me having to face any of those things at their hands. I never had to watch all my siblings receive Christmas presents while being excluded. I never had to pick cotton and live in a sharecropper shack. I never had to run from my father while he chased me around the yard throwing rocks at me. I never had to wake up in the middle of the night and escape to the neighbor's house because my dad was home and drunk and looking for 'comfort.' These are the things my parents grew up with. They never repeated the cycle with me or my brother. By the time I was born, they both had college degrees and my father was working on his Masters at Seminary. I attended school in two different school districts, but that doesn't seem so unusual. I had friends and played little league and was in the cub scouts and ran from bullies after school and listened to a lot of music and took band class and kissed girls. In the summers I walked to the swimming pool and read a lot of books at the library. All of this seems very normal to me.

        For the opposition, yes, there are a few things that perhaps most kids didn't have to deal with. My father was a preacher in a conservative Baptist church. The Southern Baptist Convention wasn't considered fundamentalist at the time, but when that group made their move in the late 70's and early 80's they were swept into power by people like my dad.

        Before I was born my parents dedicated me, their firstborn, to the Lord for his service, specifically to be a preacher.  They took as their inspiration the Biblical story of Samuel.  Thus it was determined at the outset that my life would be painted on a canvas of parchment filled with Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek letters. I prayed the 'sinner's prayer' at the age of 7 and was baptized. I spent a minimum of three hours a week at church.  I also evidently had a mild case of ADHD, although I can recall no major issues with school teachers over this. I was frustrated with my fellow readers in first grade. I was well ahead of them when it came to phonetics and pronunciation. Mrs. Morrow had to train me to wait for her to ask me to help, just so I wouldn't read everything by myself. But that's about it.

        My parents never argued. I do remember one time when I could tell my Mom was upset about something, but then they went into the bedroom and resolved the issue. They never raised their voices in anger. I guess that's probably an argument for 'not so normal.'

        And then, of course, there is Benny. Benny was the music and/or youth director of a Baptist church in Rankin, Texas. Their Southern Baptist church was in our same local 'conference' and the pastors all knew each other and met a few times a year. After one such meeting somewhere, or maybe it was a 'revival' service, we were eating at the local steak house and Benny offered to let me spend a day with he and some of the kids in their church in Rankin. I guess he pitched the idea to my parents as a babysitting opportunity, something like that. So he picked me up and I went on a big road trip. I was somewhere in the 9-12 years old range, I think.

        I remember two different events from that weekend. One was my first driving experience. Benny evidently thought this would be something I would really like. I remember being rather ambivalent about it. I was too young for any sort of car or driving motivation, and I was nervous too. But he insisted, and so I guided his Corvair down a dirt road and managed to do so without ending up in a ditch. He drove us back out. I was relieved it was over, but I had a small sense of accomplishment, as if I was at least partially aware of the rite of passage nature of it all. But then I was sworn to secrecy. OK, fine by me, no big deal.

        The other thing I remember was his house. The memories here are just flashes. I remember Benny giving himself injections in his legs. I guess he was diabetic. I also remember some other kids hanging around, all boys, all lying on the floor or couches or chairs, watching TV, wearing nothing but their underwear. Benny encouraged me to do the same, you know, just to be comfortable. Never mind the fact that 'comfort' had never been something I had consciously sought out, especially regarding clothes. I just wore whatever I wore. Even then it seemed a bit odd, but I joined in. We watched TV mostly.

        I don't remember if any of these other kids stayed overnight or not. But I did, and Benny let me share his bed. He also introduced me to the concept of masturbation, or, to be more accurate, the hand job. Reciprocation was awkward and not particularly heartfelt.

        At some later date my parents were informed that Benny had been outed and chased out of town and they had a talk with me. I'm sure they were mortified, but I honestly don't recall feeling particularly traumatized. I've often wondered if he was really chased out of town, or if he just disappeared. I've wondered if he ended up buried in some remote part of some west Texas ranch or oilfield. Or maybe he just moved elsewhere and started over.

        Having said all that, I'm not sure this qualifies as an argument for not being normal. A LOT of kids are sexually molested. It's a lot more normal than we might think. Still, I'm not objective on this one, so I'll defer to the judges.

        So that's it, my childhood. Pretty normal, except for when it wasn't.

    - The Best Album Ever

        ```markdown
        Growing up fundy presents challenges above and beyond the usual rites of passage. In some ways it is simpler: no need to worry about asking a girl to the prom, for example, since a prom involves dancing and a high likelihood of kids sneaking out to the parking lot to drink. So, problem solved, no prom for you! On the other hand, it's difficult to deal with the peer pressure surrounding events like this, especially when you're not exactly convinced of the holy edicts behind such restrictions. 

        Humor is often at its best when it illuminates a truth. In that spirit, here are a couple of jokes that I find illustrative. 

        Baptists don't cuss, drink, dance, smoke or want to.

        OK, that isn't really much of a joke, more like a Texas version of the Southern Baptist doctrinal statement. Try this one on:

        Why don't Baptists have sex standing up?
        Because they're afraid someone might see them and think they were dancing!

        Like I said, illustrative.

        A similar problem presented itself regarding music. Classical music, patriotic music and military marches were all fine. Anything else was considered 'secular' and therefore off-limits. So no country, disco, R&B, blues, or rock. Jazz was sort of a grey area. Of course the main problem with this was that you were restricted to vinyl records or the occasional Sunday church service on the radio. The most secular album we ever owned during my childhood was something called Hootenanny '64, with folk songs from Bob Dylan, Flatt & Scruggs, Johnny Cash and the New Christy Minstrels. I'm sure this album was something my Mom picked out. Only in North Carolina could 'hootenanny' be considered a word in the English language.

        One of my earliest memories is standing in the seat of the car while my mom drove around the block waiting for dad to get off work and exit the office building. I've always associated this with Petula Clark's 'Downtown' which topped the charts in late '64/early '65. Later, in dusty Big Lake, when I inherited an old Zenith AM/FM desktop radio, the universe was revealed. For me, the radio was forbidden fruit. The local radio station only existed due to a wealthy widow benefactor. The call sign was KWGH, the GH being her initials: Gracie Hickman. It was AM and played only daylight hours, but the last hour on certain days was set aside for rock. Only later did I figure out that this was most likely a local resident or high school student playing from their own personal collection.

        This was my introduction to music outside of the church hymnal. I was drawn in like a moth to a flame. I recorded songs onto a cassette tape in order to be able to hear them again at my leisure. I heard Black Sabbath's "Iron Man", Steely Dan's "Do It Again," Bill Withers' "Ain't No Sunshine." My buddy Bruce and I tried to sing along, being forced to count how many times Bill sang 'I know' during the bridge. I even did my first ever remix with my cassette tape player. I recorded over a portion of a song so David Bowie sang "This is Major Tom to ground control, I'm stepping out the door" followed by a scream. I'm still proud of that one. At night my world expanded. Atmospheric skip brought in radio signals from Oklahoma City and New Orleans. I lay in the dark reveling to the exotic "In The Jungle/Lion Sleeps Tonight," or sometimes this crazy deejay who called himself Wolfman Jack from the Mexico side of Del Rio.

        In 1973 we visited the big city of Lake Worth, a suburb of the D/FW metromess. Dad was invited to preach at a First Baptist Lake Worth 'in lieu of a call,' which meant we might move back to the area near where I was born. We stayed with long-time friends of my parents, members of the church. While the adults were talking, I took my small FM transistor radio outside and scanned up and down the dial. So many stations! I was in heaven.

        When we moved to Lake Worth that summer I was sad to say goodbye to my childhood friends, but excited at the plethora of music now available to me. Top 40 stations, R&B from K104, the black rocker. Album cuts from the Zoo, KZEW. It was a musical and cultural education.

        The new idea which was added into the mix was Jesus music. Originally this was a combination of fold and more modern southern gospel blended into something any converted hippy could enjoy and sing along to. Eventually it morphed into CCM, Contemporary Christian Music, much more akin to rock. Unfortunately it was difficult to find music like this on the radio. Station owners had a hard time with the demographics and stations came and went quickly. When a decent station was up and running, I listened frequently. But I tended to turn the dial when ads came on so I ended up listening to rock most often. Yet I was conflicted. Most of the time I felt like it was a worldly influence, distracting me from God's will.

        The summer between my junior and senior years I mailed in a form to Columbia Records to order eight albums for a total of ninety-nine cents.  I agreed to buy a few more over the next year or two.  It was a no-brainer for me.  The only music we owned that interested me at that time was a couple of eight-track tapes - one southern gospel, one Andre Crouch.  When my albums arrived I spent a few days just listening to them all.  I played them all once through before repeating.  It was a â€˜best-ofâ€™ list from the hey-day of classic rock.  Chicago IX, their first Greatest Hits album, including 25 or 6 to 4, Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?, Colour My World, Just You â€˜Nâ€™ Me, Saturday in the Park, Feelinâ€™ Stronger Every Day, Make Me Smileâ€¦.every song was a big hit.  Aerosmithâ€™s Toys in the Attic, with the hits Toys in the Attic, Walk This Way, Sweet Emotion.  I also liked Uncle Salty and Big Ten Inch.  Billy Joelâ€™s 52nd Street, with My Life, Big Shot and Honesty and the title track which I enjoyed.  I liked the jazz angle in general.  

        ***skip?***

        I had one of Eddie Moneyâ€™s early albums.  I also had a couple of one-hit wonders, Billy Thorpeâ€™s Children of the Sun and Sweetâ€™s Love is like Oxygen.  I may have purchased those as singles though.  But all of those received scant play, or at least selective play, compared to what turned out to be the â€˜big fiveâ€™ of the albums I got that summer. 

        I was turned on to Rick Wakeman by my friend Dale.  Dale was a senior when I was a freshman and he took me under his wing in a few areas.  For one, he was â€˜first chairâ€™ in the percussion section and played our new and funky quad-toms during parades and football games.  It was a bit odd to see him do this because he had some sort of problem with his ankles and they had required surgery at some point, involving pins and screws.  They had healed fine, but his ankles were thin and as he began working out it made him a bit top-heavy.  But he took to working out like he did to drums and within a few years was competing in bodybuilding competitions.  He often took me to Carswell Air Force Base to work out in their gym.  This was my first opportunity to actually do weight lifting and I actually ended up developing my quads, lats, biceps and triceps to the point where I could actually tell looking in the mirror.  Dale drove this crazy Plymouth Arrow and was always playing Emerson Lake and Palmerâ€™s Brain Salad Surgery or Six Wives of Henry the Eighth by Rick Wakeman.  Rick also had done a themed album on Journey to the Center of the Earth that we listened to on Daleâ€™s super-cool Quadrophonic stereo at his house.  So when I picked my albums I ended up choosing Rickâ€™s No Earthly Connection.  The album cover had a strangely distorted artwork rendition of Rick in his typical concert garb and some very 70â€™s electronic looking stuff.  I opened it up and it contained a thin sheet of silver plastic.  I was instructed to roll this into a tube and tape it into that shape, and then stand the tube on its end right in the center of the cover.  Voila, a somewhat realistic properly-proportioned reflection of the cover art appeared!  It was just cool.  But so was the music.  Rickâ€™s skill and creativity inspired me greatly in my piano playing.  I played that one over and over.  Just remember, every time you hear the wild, intense and fast Hammond B3  on Yesâ€™ Roundaboutâ€¦â€¦thatâ€™s Rick Wakeman.

        Another big influence was Supertrampâ€™s Even In the Quietest Moments.  The big hits were Give a Little Bit and From Now On but no song was under four minutes so it didnâ€™t lend itself well to singles airplay, yet it was their first Gold album in the U.S.  This was the era of the album-rock FM station and Foolâ€™s Overture (at almost eleven minutes) and Even In the Quietest Moments at six and a half both got a fair amount of play.  To this day I can put on this CD and listen at least once all the way through without feeling compelled to skip to the next song.  It was full of lyrics that seemed to mean something (Spiritual?  Political?  I knew not.) and anthemic big music to back up the words.

        At some point I ended up with a Boston album.  I think it was the second one, but I couldnâ€™t swear to it.  The sound, the energy, the drumming all pumped me up.  It is a rare Boston song that I didnâ€™t thoroughly enjoy, and I admired Sib Hashianâ€™s big fro look.

        Dan Fogelbergâ€™s album Nether Lands was another one that got a lot of play time.  It is packed with emotion, very evocative.  His vocals are like a strong whisper.  The lyrics, like Supertrampâ€™s, seem to have deep and hidden meanings.  Thirty years after my first exposure I still get goose bumps from both the music and the words.  The title track instantly evokes the feeling of hiking along the top of a snow-covered ridge, even for someone like me who had never been there. 
         
        Off in the Nether Lands I heard the sound
        Like the beating of heavenly wings
        And deep in my brain I can hear a refrain
        Of my soul as she rises and sings
        Anthems to glory and anthems to love
        And hymns filled with earthly delight
        Like the songs that the darkness composes to worship the light 

        Itâ€™s one of the songs that can bring tears to your eyes, even though you may not know why.  Itâ€™s done that many times for me.

        And finally, the one Iâ€™ve saved for last.  It isnâ€™t quite as deep and introspective as Nether Lands, most of the songs are shorter and more readily playable commercially on the radio unlike Supertramp, but I did more air drumming and guitar and keyboard to this album than all the others.  When I first began building a CD collection this was one of my first purchases.  I consider it the best album of all time.  Aja, by Steely Dan.

        It is mostly jazz fusion.  Black Cow sets the funky jazz tone, then Aja just runs with it.  It starts smooth and silky and ends with some of the hottest jazz/rock to ever be laid down on a piece of vinyl.  Deacon Blues reminds me of a smoky bar and is utterly listenable and singable.  The big commercial hit of the album is Peg.  Home at Last is solid all the way through and has some of the coolest piano chops youâ€™ll ever hear.  I Got The News is just fun!  The piano is very syncopated and difficult to reproduce.  I love the beat.  And Josie - well, sheâ€™s the raw flame, the live wire, she prays like a Roman with her eyes on fire.  Another awesome groove on this tune.

        In summary, there is not a song on this album that I have ever grown tired of.  Not a bad result for an album thirty years old.

        The music that I enjoyed and listened to varied a bit over the years, but I think I can lay down some general rules.  First, it had to be creative and unique.  I rarely enjoyed formulaic pop crap.  I got over anything from the Osmonds and the Jackson 5 and such by the first time I was hearing Stevie Wonder and Whoâ€™s That Lady from the Isley Brothers.  This is also why I never got into country or old-time blues.  Right after we moved to Lake Worth I expanded my musical horizons as far as I could.  I remember hearing late-night jazz on some FM station which was my first encounter with Michael Frankâ€™s Eggplant and Cat Stevensâ€™ Was Dog A Doughnut.  Any time that Dog song played I would make my friends stop and listen.  Something about the sampled dog bark just got my attention.

        If you've stuck with me this long, you're probably expecting me to talk about some of the wonderful albums I added to this nice starter set over the years. Unfortunately, there was no such addition. As a matter of fact, during my first semester at Dallas Baptist University my new friend Mark and I went just a little crazy with our research into the Bible's many references to the demonic realm. We became so paranoid that we took any decoration hanging on our dorm room walls and wrote scriptures on the back, lest they provide some sort of portal for demons to sneak in during the night. Another possible means of attack was music. Yep, you guessed it, my album collection had to go! So in a moment of fervor, I took all of them down the hall and tossed them into a garbage can. But I quickly felt bad about this decision. What if some other poor soul found them and played them? Then *they* would be demonized! So I attempted to discourage their retrieval by soaking them in Dr. Pepper. And that was the end of my secular vinyl collection.

    - The Fundamentals

        ```markdown
        In 1689, William of Orange, newly crowned king, landed on the northern and eastern shores of Ireland to take the island back from the Catholics. The Irish armies were led by the former king, James, who also happened to be William's uncle *and* father-in-law. Awkward! It was also a dangerous time to be a pacifist Quaker in Ireland. Many of them decided it would be a good time to check out this new place they had heard of, Penn's Colony. And that is how Rose and Dinah and their brother William Dixon ended up living south of Philadelphia, in what is now northern Delaware.

        Fifty years later many of these Quaker Dixons and their friends and families migrated south to north central North Carolina. They began farming and building grist mills along Tick Ridge, which overlooked Tick Creek. A few generations and a revolution later many of them again migrated to the new frontier, an area promising no slavery and lots of open land, the Northwest Territories. From 1804 onward, they occasionally migrated westward from Ohio until eventually my father was born in southeast Iowa.

        Back in North Carolina, coincidentally, another group of Dixons, hopefully not *too* directly related, were making their mark. Thomas Dixon had two sons in Shelby, North Carolina, my mother's home town (also coincidentally). The eldest son, Amzi (who went by his initials, A.C.), was born in 1854. His younger brother, Thomas, Jr., was born in 1864, a brotherhood bookending the Civil War. Thomas Jr. Was a Southern Baptist minister, playwright, lecturer, North Carolina state legislator, lawyer, and author. At some point, while traveling and lecturing, he saw a theatrical performance of Harriet Beecher Stowe's "Uncle Tom's Cabin" and was overwhelmed with despair at its treatment of southerners. He was so angry, he wrote a trilogy of books, published from 1902-1907, giving what he considered to be the 'true story' of the South, even recycling characters from Uncle Tom's Cabin!

        In 1915 the second novel in the trilogy, The Clansman, was adapted into a ground-breaking silent film, The Birth of a Nation. His books and the film they inspired are widely regarded as being directly responsible for the rebirth of the Ku Klux Klan.

        Thomas' older brother, A.C., chose a slightly different path. While he was pastor of Moody Church in Chicago, his sermons impressed a businessman, one Lyman Stewart, founder of Union Oil, a.k.a. Unocal. Lyman wanted to produce a volume of works that would be a 'testimony to the truth' and a scholarly tour de force. He hired A.C. on as editor, later to be joined by R.A. Torrey, the former pastor of Moody Church. From 1910 to 1915 they collected 90 theological essays by 64 authors and published them in a 12-volume set. It covered a lot of ground and was entitled "The Fundamentals." It is widely regarded as the foundation of modern Christian fundamentalism.

        Dixon's co-editor, R.A. Torrey, was involved in both the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago and later headed up  Lyman Stewart's 'Bible Institute of Los Angeles' (now Biola University) and the church started for him, the Church of the Open Door. At some point one of his students was one Grier 'Pops' Mobley. Pops served in the Army and ended up retired in Hawaii leading bible study classes at the Nuuanu Baptist Church in Honolulu and evangelizing and spreading Torrey's fundamentalism among young, impressionable servicemen. One of those young acolytes would be my father, stationed at Pearl Harbor during the Korean War.

        Two brothers, living 150 miles from my ancestor Quaker relatives, born in the town my Mother would shortly call home. Both would fan the flames of fundamentalist movements centered on race and patriarchal tradition and narrow interpretations. A. C. hated "Roman Catholicism, liquor and licentiousness, gambling, Henry Ward Beecherâ€™s liberalism, Robert Ingersollâ€™s agnosticism, Christian Science, Unitarianism, and higher criticism of the Bible."
