# ADHD_vs_Fundamentalism

NOTE: While these two things were definitely factors, I’m not sure they work as ‘themes’ per se - they need to sit to the sides, like the proverbial angel and devil on my shoulders. The theme needs to be something else. ADHD and Fundamentalism help explain why I did what I did at certain times, but the theme should be Explore the tension between the two. 

Example: Sex

Sex drive is healthy and normal in teenagers. A common-sense response is to use birth control and/or condoms and have the sex without the complications. The relationship either lasts or it doesn’t, but pregnancy and parenthood is understood to be something best done when financially secure and in a committed relationship. Here’s how that got screwed up for me.

First, birth control was never an option. To pre-plan to have sex is not only to sin, but to intentionally sin! It’s a double-whammy of christian guilt. One should abstain until married, period.

Second, ADHD overrides both this abstinence principle and common sense by adding an extra dose of impulsivity to an already hormone-flooded brain right when you are caught in a birth-control-free zone. The result is that you push the situation to the edge and end up utilizing really bad ideas like coitus interruptus. Frankly, I will not be surprised to one day find out that I have a child from one of my former girlfriends. I’ve had this conversation with one of them, but in spite of the denials I am still slightly suspicious. I drove another one to Planned Parenthood. I honestly don’t know if she just got a check-up, a pregnancy test or an abortion. I waited in the car. Yes, I was that naive. And my first wife claims to have had a miscarriage her first semester at college with me. She was also in training to be a pathological liar, so I’ll just never know about that one. However, you can see that fundamentalist religious teachings and ADHD are quite the volatile and dangerous combination when it comes to sex.
