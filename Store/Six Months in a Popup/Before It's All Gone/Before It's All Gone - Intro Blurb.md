All these forces are constantly at work to transform the world. There has always been a certain amount of risk that something of significance or beauty might not be here tomorrow. But now an unholy alliance has been formed, where we humans have managed to significantly alter the natural cycle. The atmosphere is heating up, and storms and fire hazards are growing. Glaciers and arctic ice are shrinking. Species are dying.

Soon, probably in your lifetime, a world full of wonders will be gone, some of it forever. If there is something you desire to see, don't delay. Go now, before it's all gone.
