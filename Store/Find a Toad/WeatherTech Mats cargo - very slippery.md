The WeatherTech All-Weather floor mats are finally available. These are not the floor liners. Differences between the floor liners and the all-weather floor mats include:

1. Floor liners provide better coverage and are custom fit. 2. Floor liners are more expensive. 3. Floor liners have a more plastic look/feel. 4. All-weather floor mats are custom fit but do not provide complete coverage. 5. All-weather floor mats are less expensive (list $69.95 for front). 6. All-weather floor mats have a very rubber look and feel.

WeatherTech part number is W419.
