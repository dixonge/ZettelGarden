    BumpShox utilizes a recessed screw design, where the mounting screws are recessed into the product to help prevent damage to another vehicleâ€™s bumper during parking. Every year drivers spend millions of dollars fixing bumpers that are damaged by the protruding screws of other vehicles. BumpShox is designed without any protruding metal parts that can damage another vehicle.
