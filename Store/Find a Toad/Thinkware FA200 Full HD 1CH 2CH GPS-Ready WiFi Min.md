The Thinkware FA200 is the all-around reliable and economical dash cam you've been waiting for. Designed with utmost discretion in mind while packed with features such as built-in WiFi and Advanced Parking Mode, this sleek and compact dash cam offers 1 or 2-channel recording, so you can rest easy knowing the FA200 has your back. Let's dig in to the features!

### Built-in WiFi

Use the built-in WiFi and Thinkware mobile app (available for compatible iOS and Android smartphones) to position your dash cam, review videos, and customize your settings. Thinkware's FA200 mobile app features various configuration modes, for you to navigate and tweak your dash cam to perfection.

### Advanced Parking Mode

Thinkware Advanced Parking Mode will protect your car while the ignition is turned off. It's most notable features are:

- Impact Detection will capture impacts caused to the vehicle such as any hit-and-run driver in the act while you are away.
- Motion Detection will capture any motion around the vehicle for potential vandalism attempts.
- Energy Saving in Parking Mode extends coverage duration exponentially by keeping the dash cam in a power-saving mode during inactivity. The dash cam enters a Sleep Mode and wakes up almost instantly after an impact has been detected to safely record and store the next 20 seconds.

### Time Lapse*

This unique Parking Mode feature is perfect for dash cams with smaller SD cards. Time Lapse records footage at a lower frame rate while reducing video size, to cover a longer period of surveillance. This feature operates for up to 72 hours (3 days) after the ignition is turned off.

**Available with the optional hardwiring kit. Subject to vehicle battery size/health.*

### Integrated Thermal Protection

The Integrated Super Capacitor and Thermal Sensor enhances reliability in extreme temperatures. When a vehicle gets too hot, Thinkware's Thermal Sensor will automatically turn off the dash cam. The Super Capacitor is also a reliable alternative to traditional lithium-ion batteries, as there are no chemicals which contain potentially dangerous contents.

### Safety Camera Alerts*

With the optional GPS antenna, the dash cam can track the road and direction of travel to notify the driver of photo enforced areas for safe driving.

**Safety camera alerts must be enabled. GPS Antenna (sold separately) required.*

### Full HD 1080p with 140° Viewing Angle

Records 140° distortion free, wide view angle in Full HD 1080p at 30 fps with Wide Dynamic Range for correctly exposed, true-color video.

### Anti-File Corruption

Saving and managing your video footage is just as important as recording high quality videos. Stop data fragmentation and file corruption with Thinkware's Anti-File Corruption Technology.

By dedicating pre-allocated space in your memory card for each video segment, this prevents bad data-storage and eliminates the need for defragmentation, while extending the life of your memory card.

### PC Viewer (for Windows and Mac OS)

Thinkware PC Viewer is your one-stop destination to conveniently review everything related to your dash cam, from incident footage to location details. Switch between Front-Camera Display, and Google Map Display, and more, while reviewing the footage in your Video Playlist Manager.

The FA200 is great for a number of reasons. We love that you can expand the functionality later by adding a secondary camera or GPS antenna, should you decide you'd like to have those add-ons (something you can't always do with 1-channel dashcams). Excellent cost, reliability of the Thinkware brand, and advanced parking mode features make the FA200 an excellent choice for price-concious drivers and business owners who still desire discreet recording and constant protection.
