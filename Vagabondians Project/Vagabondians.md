# Welcome

Shortly after Glenn's 50th birthday, he and his wife, Bryn, quit their jobs and went traveling. They spent the first year seeing the amazing sights and sounds of their home country.

See 'Seven Months in a Popup Camper' in the main menu section

In 2012 they lived in and traveled throughout Mexico, from Lake Chapala in the west to San Cristobal de las Casas in the east, as well as Guatemala.

In 2013 they visited Belize, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Mexico again. They moved back to Lake Chapala's large expat community in 2014 until they almost ran out of money! In 2015 they moved back to Texas. Glenn went back to work in Austin for two years until he finally became vested in his pension plan, while Bryn walked dogs and experimented with recipes for their new vegan lifestyle. In 2017, at long last, Bryn was able to *take* her pension so they *officially* retired and moved back to Lake Chapala in Mexico!

Two years later they moved to Zacatecas. There they enjoyed the high desert, low rent, and getting more practice in Spanish as some of the very few gringos in town.

After the initial coronavirus lockdowns began to lift, they rented a car, drove across Mexico to Reynosa and walked back across the border into McAllen, Texas. They now live in an RV, seeking safety from extreme temperatures and viruses while being surrounded by trees and wildlife. 

As of 2020 they have visited:

- [Seven countries](https://vagabondians.com/#), by land, sea and air
- Forty-three states in the U.S.
- Eighteen states in Mexico
- Twenty-plus airports, from Fairbanks, AK to Newark, NJ to San Jose, Costa Rica
