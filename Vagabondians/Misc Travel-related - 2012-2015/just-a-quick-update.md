# just-a-quick-update

Yep, we’re still in Texas!

Actually, Bryn made a trip to Michigan to see her sister. I’m still in Texas.

Bryn has finished her TEFL certificate classes, and I am busy working on WordPress sites for various clients. We hope to be back on the road by the first week in June, probably headed for Nicaragua unless plans shift. Still have lots of changes to make to the site here and lots of photos and video yet to post. We’ll get caught up on all that eventually.

Thanks for reading!
