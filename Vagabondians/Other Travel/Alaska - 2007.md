# Alaska - 2007

In 2007 we traveled by air to Vancouver, B.C. and then took a cruise to Alaska. Our friends flew back home from there, we took a rental car and visited Denali National Park and Fairbanks. And the North Pole (the city). Then we flew back from Fairbanks.

I bought a new camera for this trip and gave it quite the workout. I'm fairly certain I took at least 5,000 photos. I have placed some of these on Flickr here and there, but the task of culling, sorting, organizing, etc. has always seemed daunting. Hopefully I can resolve this in the near future. When I do, highlights will go here with links to full albums elsewhere.
