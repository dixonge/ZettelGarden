# we-woke-up-in-nicaragua

Country/State: [[Nicaragua]]

Waking up in Nicaragua is different!  Bird calls outside the window.  Lots of them – including a polite rooster across the drainage ditch who waited until after the sun was up to crow only one series of cock-a-doodle-doos.  (The Mexican ones crow constantly for any reason, not just good-morning!)

Mangos outside our hostel

In just a few minutes I have seen some fat brown birds, several great kiskadees, numerous doves, some beautiful dusky blue birds resembling blue budgies in pet stores but larger, and a gorgeous yellow and black bird with a bright orange hood.  And here we are in the middle of Managua, the bustling capitol of Nicaragua, though we are in a poorer barrio, not downtown.

Sitting in the hostal kitchen with the sounds of cars and horse carts going by outside.  Thus begins our newest adventure in a new country!
