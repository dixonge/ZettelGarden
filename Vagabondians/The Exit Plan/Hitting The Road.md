While Bryn traveled to Oklahoma City today for a funeral Glenn had time to finally edit some video.  This is something he shot when we left our apartments back on March 31.  The video was all done in one shot.  Music courtesy of Boston. [UPDATE: Evidently YouTube has *removed* the music, even though they still show all of the credits for the song...not sure what to do about that, other than re-upload it or put it on my own site. ]
