I had a [long, lovely chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he-495SW9CI&t=5244s) with doctor and [YouTuber Ali Abdaal](https://aliabdaal.com/deep-dive-23-austin-kleon/) this week. He read my book *[Show Your Work!](https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work)* in 2016 and said it inspired him to start sharing online. (He now has over a million subscribers and makes more money as a YouTuber than a doctor!)

One of the topics from the book we discussed is how much you learn when you have the courage to share what *you* have learned, regardless of your level of expertise.

It was certainly true of our conversation, as I learned something really interesting from Ali: he says he gets way better results with his YouTube videos when he titles them, “How I Remember Everything I Read,” instead of “How to Remember Everything You Read.” There’s something about using the first-person pronoun that opens things up, lets him speak from his own experience, and lets viewers feel like they can take what they need and do their own thing.

Here is how Ali [summarized](https://aliabdaal.com/deep-dive-23-austin-kleon/) the first lesson from *[Show Your Work!](https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work)*:

> Stop worrying about becoming an expert before you start. Teaching that comes from a fellow student is often more impactful than teaching from an expert. C.S.Lewis once said “fellow schoolboys can teach fellow students just as effectively as the teacher”. It’s the difference between saying ‘I’m an expert and I’m going to teach you something’, and saying ‘I’m a fellow student and I’m going to share what I’ve learnt and maybe you can take something from this’.

In his recent piece, “[How Nick Quah Became the Podcast Whisperer](https://marker.medium.com/how-a-malaysian-immigrant-in-idaho-became-the-go-to-expert-on-podcasting-a240c761928b),” my friend [Rob Walker](https://austinkleon.com/tag/rob-walker) wrote about how Quah went from outsider to industry expert by starting a [newsletter](https://austinkleon.com/2018/06/05/how-i-put-a-newsletter-together/) on his lunch break:

> By his own account, Quah’s actual qualifications for taking on the role of public thinker on podcasting were nil. He’d never made a podcast, had no background in radio or audio media of any kind. In fact, he was not long out of college and a few months into his first media job, an entry-level gig at Business Insider that he describes as closer to market research than journalism. He was basically some random guy with a new off-hours hobby…. Within a couple years of starting his newsletter, this random guy was able to quit his day job and become, for lack of a better word, a full-time expert…

Rob writes, “More than ever, expertise seems to have become a DIY affair; strategic and determined obsession can replace specific credentials or a tangible track record.”

Again, it’s not about being credentialed or being an expert, it’s about seeing a space open up, starting to do work that needs doing, sharing your ideas, and sticking around long enough so people show up and you can interact with them in a meaningful way and build something lasting.

Part of this is also [forgetting about job titles](https://austinkleon.com/2018/11/09/we-are-verbs-not-nouns/) and focusing on the work that should be done. Here’s a brief clip from [a longer conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pVoOrVaIl0&t=981s) I had with Nelda Sue Yaw about an idea from my book *[Keep Going](https://austinkleon.com/keepgoing)*:

The crucial thing, I think, is that if you *do* get the job title, if you *do* become something like an “expert” or “professional” in your field, you must retain an amateur’s spirit and [remain a student](https://austinkleon.com/2015/06/14/to-be-a-teacher-and-remain-a-student/), so that you can benefit from the best thing about having your work out in world: the “[free education that goes on for a lifetime](https://austinkleon.com/2019/05/31/a-free-education-that-goes-on-for-a-lifetime/).”
