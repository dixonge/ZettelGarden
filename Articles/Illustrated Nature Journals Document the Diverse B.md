Many artists find inspiration in the diverse beauty of the environment. UK-based illustrator [Jo Brown](https://bernoid.com/) documents the discoveries she makes during outdoor excursions in her colorful *Nature Journals*. Each notebook spread contains exquisite drawings and notes of plants and animals that she sees in the Devon countryside. What makes her *Nature Journals* particularly eye-catching is the way Brown utilizes the entire page for her full-bleed illustrations. By doing so, her vibrant compositions appear to pop off of the page.

According to her [website](https://bernoid.com/), Brown “started the journal because she wanted to record the things she was discovering as she found them because nature is one of the most important things in her life.” Featured in her portfolio are careful renderings of carnivorous plants, tiny insects, and indigenous birds. And she didn't have to look far for them, either; Brown says that most of the nature she depicts are things that anyone can find with “a little patience and quiet observation.”

Brown uses a combination of fine-nib pens and colored pencils to capture her subjects in splendid detail. Much like scientific illustrations, she often includes close-up shots of specific components, such as minute insect eggs. Along the edge of the drawings, Brown adds educational jottings of the flora and fauna, including the Latin name of each species.
