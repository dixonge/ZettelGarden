# ACA Insurance - HCSM comparison - great thoughts on religious tax exemption

Actually, being on your knees every Sunday wouldn't fulfill Medi-Share's requirements--"members must attend a fellowship of believers and actively support that ministry."

And there's nothing to say they won't start verifying people's lifestyles or adherence to the requirements for membership. And you can bet that if they do, it won't be to keep people from joining and paying premiums "making contributions," but instead to keep from paying claims, which is the worst case scenario for any member--paying for membership and then having claims denied.

But at least with regulated insurance companies, there are some standards and oversight. And with ACA plans, there are more standards, like not denying claims because of pre-existing conditions and various things that must be covered.

Plus, you specifically said people don't have to be Christian to join Medi-Share. You can't do that and then hide behind telling people to do due diligence before jumping in. Or, well, you can, obviously. But it's not right.

And to me, there's also a moral angle. One reason health insurance, especially ACA-complaint health insurance, is so expensive is that it covers sick people. I remember a few years ago an agent tried to sell me a plan that was available to me because I'm healthy. It was pretty cheap and had good coverage, but it turned out that if I got sick, I would have to move to a higher level of plan (with a higher premium), and even then, they would keep me enrolled only until the next open enrollment period, at which point they'd kick me off and presumably I'd switch to Obamacare, since it's the only place people with pre-existing conditions can get coverage. So they were insuring only healthy people, and letting someone else (i.e., the government) do the dirty/expensive work of covering people who are sick.

I think this is amoral, and I'm not sure the Christian healthshare ministries are much better. They say they will cover pre-existing conditions after a certain number of years, but there's nothing actually requiring them to do so, since every payment they make is completely voluntary. On the one hand, at least they don't kick you off if you get sick, but is it really that much better to allow someone to keep paying premiums "making contributions" when they're likely to have crushing "requests" for payment that the healthshare ministry would have an incentive to deny?

Furthermore, all Americans support religion, whether they participate or not, through paying more taxes to make up for the taxes that religious organizations and their contributors don't have to pay. It seems to me a bit disingenuous for Christians to not only carve themselves out of the system designed to provide healthcare for Americans, but in doing so to contribute to its destruction by peeling off the healthy people whose lower claims would help support the higher claims of others.

People don't have a choice about bestowing their tax dollars on religious enterprises, and yet the participants in the religious enterprises get to choose to bestow their healthcare dollars only on people whose lifestyles they approve of. That doesn't seem particularly Christ-like.

And I was disturbed by the authorities' allegation that Aliera used just 20 cents out of every dollar "contributed" to pay medical claims. As the Houston Chronicle article noted, that's exactly the opposite of regulated insurance companies, which are required to pay out 80% of premium dollars in claims, and if they don't, they have to write their members a check. That's a good example of the benefits of regulation.

All that said, I wonder if the "Christian" part of these schemes is just a loophole that's being exploited. The good news is that it could mean they wouldn't be all that strict about members adhering to the requirements, especially if they're paying out only 20 cents on the dollar--the more members, the more money.

But that's only as long as things are going well. If it starts to collapse, then it's possible that whoever's in charge of the healthshare ministry would start looking for any reason to deny claims, and whether they were serious about people being Christians before, they could invoke those requirements when claim-paying time comes. Medi-Share allows use, but not abuse, of alcohol. And they have the last word on which it is a member is doing.
