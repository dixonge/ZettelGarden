# Ancient Contributions to a Modern Philosophy of Life: Stoicism, Epicureanism, and Buddhism | by Brian P. Ellis | Medium

Tags: Philosophy

**Abstract:** Stoicism, Epicureanism, and Buddhism may be considered to be some of the most influential and enduring philosophies of life. In this essay I will argue that these life philosophies should be recognized for their historical contributions to secular ethics, that they possess ethical and practical insights which are still useful as a general guide to living well, and that these insights should be integrated into a modern secular philosophy of life. Additionally, I will argue that non-religious persons would greatly benefit from the creation of a secular philosophy of life which is partially modeled on these views.

**Introduction**

It seems fair to state that Stoicism, Epicureanism, and Buddhism are some of the most influential philosophical movements of the ancient world — considering that they are over two thousand years old and yet are still relatively well-known and continue to attract interest or adherents. These three philosophical movements have some additional commonalities beyond their influence and endurance: first, they could all be considered comprehensive philosophical schools of thought — that is, they all include a theory of knowledge ([epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology) and [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic)), of reality ([metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics)), and of how one should live ([ethical theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics)) [Note: It is debatable whether the founder of Buddhism should be considered a philosopher, or if Buddhism should be construed as a school of philosophical thought, in the traditional sense (see [Siderits, 2019](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/buddha/#BudPhi)).]; second, Stoicism, Epicureanism and Buddhism can all be considered comprehensive *philosophies of life*, in that they instruct us on how to live in a more general sense, beyond what we are used to in a modern theory of ethics — which tends to have a domain limited to addressing matters such as the nature of right and wrong, what possesses value, and how to act in regard to specific ethical questions. More specifically, these schools of thought also include a more broad ethical aim of instructing us on how to achieve a state of flourishing — or, to use the verbiage of the ancient Epicureans and Stoics, *[eudaimonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia).* Lastly, Stoicism, Epicureanism, and Buddhism are all non-religious life philosophies — in the sense of not espousing a personal or [classical theism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_theism) that is typical of traditional, highly dogmatic religion — and many of their insights are therefore adaptable to, or in line with [metaphysical naturalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysical_naturalism) — the metaphysical view which most non-religious people adhere to.

**I. What Is a Life Philosophy and What Should It Do?**

In the common parlance, a life philosophy is one’s general view of the world and how one should live in it. In this essay I will be using the term *life philosophy* in the more formal sense — that is, to refer to philosophically developed and comprehensive (see the paragraph above for what I mean by *comprehensive*) views of this sort. Life philosophies (or philosophies of life), in this sense, attempt to instruct us on how to achieve what philosophers refer to as the “good life”, or a life that is characterized by eudaimonia (or what we might call *flourishing*). Life philosophies of this sort usually entail a [normative moral theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative_ethics). Stoicism, Epicureanism, and Buddhism, are no exception here, in that they all propose a theory of normative ethics.

For the ancients, their school of philosophy was a philosophy of life, and it informed how they lived, much like religion does for its adherents in the modern world (Stock, 2014). In contrast to the ancient Greco-Roman and Eastern world, in the modern era the concept of a formalized or fully developed *philosophy of life* is somewhat of an alien concept; we are used to hearing religious persons talk about how their religious views inform how they live their lives, but we don’t often hear non-religious people talk about secular equivalents that offer guidance in their lives. This is unfortunate since the vacuum created by an absence of secular life philosophies tends to be filled by various political or cultural ideologies and traditional religious views — some of which may be devoid of a rational epistemology and promote dubious or potentially dangerous beliefs. Traditional theistic religions incorporate a [doxastic attitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxastic_attitudes) of “faith”, or belief without epistemic warrant, and are therefore not highly amenable to a rational view of the world; even their more liberal variations carry too much dogmatic and mystical “baggage” to be easily reconciled with reason. Additonally, as Sam Harris (2006) has argued, another problem with [classical theistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_theism) religions — even in their liberalized forms — is that they lend ideological support to more virulent, literalist forms.

It may be argued that Humanism serves as a philosophy of life for many atheists, agnostics, or simply non-religious people, however, it is probably more appropriate to describe Humanism as a *worldview*, and quite a vague one at that. In fact, Humanism is such a vague, “big tent” sort of worldview that if you ask ten Humanists what Humanism is, and how it informs their lifestyle, you would likely get ten very different answers. While there are some advantages to having such a big tent worldview (more members being the obvious one), there are disadvantages as well. For one, a worldview which offers very little in terms of ethical or practical life guidance will not be of much help to its adherents. What guidance does Humanism offer in times of loss, or in regards to difficult moral and existential questions? Again, very little, and the answer you get depends very much on whom you ask. The Humanist would likely point out that we all choose our own path in grappling with these issues, so overly specific instruction would not be of great help either — which is true — but I would argue that a time-tested cognitive, ethical, and existential framework to deal with these matters is needed.

One reason the framework of a life philosophy is needed is because most philosophers agree that living the good life is not easy. For example, Stoicism, Epicureanism, and Buddhism prescribe considerably difficult practices such as learning to cultivate virtues, building our will power, learning to see through illusory perceptions and cognitive errors, overriding our autopilot-like default state of consciousness, and overcoming the illogical beliefs and herd mentality of the dominant culture, etc. **Because achieving the good life is not easy, all of these philosophies of life teach that one has to commit to consistent contemplation of teachings, the use of critical thought or reason, and to developing a sense of *mindfulness* or *awareness* of one’s mental states — so that we may use reason to modulate our automatic responses.** [Note: In this regard, Stoicism and Buddhism are most instructive.] Additionally, becoming aware of things like the often overwhelming influence of the dominant culture, or the recalcitrant nature of cognitive errors and biases takes some education and instruction, and learning to overcome these obstacles requires structured guidance.

The philosopher Alain de Botton makes a similar point in his book *The Consolations of Philosophy.* He draws upon Socrates’ analogies about the trades to make the case that living the good life is the sort of thing that looks easy, but is actually very difficult — unlike pottery or shoe making, which look difficult and *are* difficult (Botton, 2014, p. 21). He continues to make this case by pointing out that in the case of pottery or shoe making we will be able to tell when someone with no expertise has made the product, but we don’t have this advantage in the case of ethical or practical life instruction. There are plenty of ideas about how to live the good life, but very few of these are carefully developed based on reason — as is the aim of philosophy. The general point here is that we would do much better to consult reason (specifically, the [dialectical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic) process used in philosophy), with regard to living the good life, rather than an *uncritical* acceptance of what is referred to as “common sense”, or the predominant opinions of the culture we inhabit.

This is where life philosophies still have practical value in the modern age. One can only learn so much in one lifetime, and there is much distilled wisdom from philosophy (e.g., ethical theory, practical life wisdom, ethical wisdom, logic, etc.) and science (e.g., methods, theories, empirically established facts, etc.) that should be passed on. This is much more difficult than one would imagine, and what is taught in schools is often insufficient. We have to develop a system for passing on what is most important from these insights and discoveries in a way that expedites what would otherwise take a lifetime of rigorous thought and study. In his [TED Talk “Atheism 2.0”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Oe6HUgrRlQ) Botton suggests that borrowing from the methods of traditional religion may be helpful (e.g., the emphasis on repetitious instruction, the use of various forms of art, the benefits of an organizational structure, etc.). Secular life philosophies can use an adaptation of such methods to teach the non-controversial axioms and methods of philosophy and science, a framework for living the good life based on ethical and practical wisdom found in philosophical schools of thought, and they can teach the importance of social responsibility (fairness and beneficence) in the context of a non-dogmatic, but philosophically informed and grounded ethical pluralism — leaving the specifics of one’s moral views and choices to the individual.

A philosophy of life may offer more than just ethical and practical life instruction — if a community centering around the life philosophy forms. Many psychological studies have shown the positive effects (e.g., lower incidence of mental and physical health problems, lower mortality) of religious belief, however, these effects are highly dependent upon involvement in the religious community (George, Larson, Koenig, McCullough, 2000; Lim & Putnam, 2010; Myers, 2000). If a secular philosophy of life can grow to the point where communities of like-minded people develop, then it seems likely that the same benefits seen in this research will be conferred to those who become involved in the community.

Of course, individuals should always be free to create their own philosophies of life, but reinventing the wheel may not be recommended or helpful; for most people it will make more sense to judiciously tailor those existing life philosophies to accord with their own critically examined beliefs. To reiterate, the idea I am advocating is that rigorously developed life philosophies can offer essential scaffolding for the individual, rather than a precise and concrete manual on how to live.

**II. What is to be Abandoned**

There is much that is sound in all three of these philosophies of life, nevertheless, I find much to disagree with as well. Most of my disagreement with Stoicism and Buddhism, in their original forms, stems from the over-reaching comprehensive nature of these philosophies of life. In other words, while I agree with a lot of Buddhist and Stoic views on living a good life, the metaphysical theories they laid out were highly speculative, and because of this some of their specific beliefs based on these theories have been superseded by the modern general philosophical consensus — one that is informed by the findings of modern science, and which has been [dialectically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic) formed through centuries of discourse. To put it bluntly, we have moved beyond the level of information and understanding available to those who developed these philosophies.

However, the fact that some aspects of these life philosophies do not correspond to our current scientific understanding is not a problem for those who seek to update these views in order to reconcile them with modern knowledge — as many modern Stoics, Epicureans, and secular Buddhists do. It can be cogently argued that Buddhism and Stoicism were created to be evolving philosophies of life (see Seneca & Inwood, 2010, p. 99, letter 65.8-9 & p. 142, letter 80.1; [Is Buddhism Scientific or Religious?](https://tricycle.org/trikedaily/buddhism-scientific-religious/)). For two examples of modern Stoics who have done excellent work to revise Stoicism in light of contemporary scientific evidence see the work of [Massimo Pigliucci](https://howtobeastoic.wordpress.com/massimo-on-stoicism/) and [Donald Robertson](https://donaldrobertson.name/donald-robertson/). Both of these authors espouse a modern Stoicism that is non-theistic and compatible with our current scientific understanding of the world.

There are, however, modern Stoics who have not divorced themselves from ancient Stoic metaphysics, so modern Stoicism is not monolithic in this regard. The vestiges of ancient Stoic metaphysics in the modern Stoic movement represent an impediment to moral progress — an issue I will address in the following section.

My critique of Epicureanism, on the other hand, is more ethical in nature (I will address this issue in the following section). Since Epicurus developed a more [parsimonious](http://www.brianpellis.net/glossary/#OR) metaphysical foundation for his philosophy — through discarding [teleological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology) explanations — his materialist metaphysics can easily be updated to agree with modern scientific understanding of the universe, and there are no problems in the way of ethical and existential views that use conjectural metaphysics as a foundation — such as is the case with Stoicism and Buddhism.

**III. General Critiques of Stoicism, Epicureanism, and Buddhism**

[Note: For the sake of brevity I will only present a general layout of what I object to in the classical forms of these life philosophies; I will not flesh out complete arguments in this brief critique.]

**General Critique of Stoicism**

Despite their insistence on logic, the ancient Stoics created a metaphysical system that was mostly based on conjecture. The Stoics held that the universe was divine — essentially that the universe was god (classical pantheism) — and that the order seen in creation or nature was a manifestation of divine logic, or what they referred to as “the logos”. This Stoic conception of pantheism was teleological — that is, it held that the logic of god, or the universe, designed the world to be a certain way and that it aimed at certain goals. While this sort of non-dogmatic pantheism is certainly preferable, from a sociocultural standpoint, to dogmatic religion, it is not supported by evidence.

A well-informed understanding of biology, and science in general, may not rule out teleology completely (philosophically, nothing can be ruled out completely), but it certainly rules out a teleology that is motivated by benevolence (such as the sort espoused by traditional theistic religions); rather, the only “teleology” that seems to be at work is of the sort described by Dawkins (see Dawkins, 1986) — one in which that term is better seen as metaphorical, where design is not the product of an intelligence, but a product of a ruthless, “blind”, jury rigging process where successful organisms out-compete and perpetuate, while those who don’t find a niche eventually die out. Philosophy, including natural philosophy (aka science), must favor the [parsimonious explanation](http://www.brianpellis.net/glossary/#OR) until it is ruled out, and ancient Stoic metaphysics contradicts this axiom.

One of the implications of the classical Stoic metaphysical view is a sort of quietism — a resigning acceptance of whatever happens, and whatever is, as divinely willed by the logos, or as a necessary occurrence in a deterministic universe. Unfortunately, many modern Stoics have taken up this acquiescent attitude, even, it appears, some of those who have eschewed the classical pantheism of ancient Stoicism. For instance, many modern Stoics are fond of the of the phrase *[amor fati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amor_fati)* (love of one’s fate)— borrowed from Nietzsche — as an expression of their view that we should not only accept what happens, but that we should strive to *love* it. [Note: An internet search for “amor fati stoicism” will bring up several examples. Incidentally, Nietzsche also had many criticisms of Stoic philosophy (see Horstmann & Norman, 2001, pp. 10–11); Nietzsche’s concept of *amor fati* had more to do with promoting an unconditional acceptance of life as it is, in opposition to a nihilistic rejection of it, rather than a reconciliation of one’s will with an inscrutable cosmic intelligence or a deterministic universe (see Nietzsche & Kaufmann, 1974, p. 223).]

It would take another essay to properly address the problems entailed by Stoic fatalism, but it will suffice to say here that this is highly problematic for a number of reasons (e.g., it presents a general coherence problem for Stoicism; it could engender an overly external [locus of control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_of_control); it may cause one to accept injustices; it serves to reinforce the entrenched [status quo bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo_bias) that clouds our judgement [which may impede moral progress]; etc.).

Fortunately, Stoic ethics and the Stoic precursors to cognitive psychotherapy do not require Stoic metaphysics as a foundation. What is good in Stoicism can be supported by a metaphysical view that does not invoke divine teleology, but rather is grounded in empirically established knowledge.

In regards to the question of how we are to live, I also find the Stoic insistence that only moral virtue is intrinsically good to be staid and unappealing. My own views fall more in line with Epicurus’ — that a life that is not pleasurable is not worth living, but that virtue is a necessary instrumental good if one is to live a happy life. I feel that any account of the good life that does not factor in the importance of pleasure is missing something essential.

**General Critique of Epicureanism**

A common critique of Epicurus’ philosophy of life is that it recommended non-involvement in political matters of society. This isolationism seems to have been mostly based on the belief that involvement in the cultural or political fray could only decrease one’s life satisfaction (Epicurus, Inwood, & Gerson, 1994, p. 39 & p. 43). This view may not hold truth in every situation, but when you consider the historical context in which Epicurus wrote — where political assassinations occurred with relative frequency, and in which imprisonment or capital punishment for sedition or impiety were a legitimate concern — the Epicurean position does not seem as unjustifiable. When a culture reaches a certain level of toxicity, perhaps the wisest form of rebellion is to drop out and live as you think a person should — as both a symbolic protest and as a way to encourage change by demonstrating what a just life should look like. However, it is not clear, based on the extant writings (many Epicurean writings were lost to history) if Epicurus was suggesting such a tactic.

It could also be argued that Epicurus may have felt that if everyone lived a eudaimoniaic life there would be no need for political squabbling, as everyone would peaceably coexist in a state of ataraxic harmony — perhaps in some sort of confederation of communes. Again, in this case, the idea of staying out of political matters may have stemmed from the belief that more good could be done outside of the predominant political system; however, as with my previous defense of Epicurean isolationism, this is only conjecture. While I sympathize with the impulse to remove oneself from dangerous, stress-inducing, and seemingly futile efforts, sociopolitical isolationism is an ethically problematic stance in the modern world for many reasons. A tenable modern philosophy of life must incorporate a duty to work toward creating a more just society.

**General Critique of Buddhism**

It is claimed that the founder of Buddhism avoided all metaphysical speculation (Smith, 2009, p. 95), however, the founder of Buddhism took the speculative metaphysical views of his culture for granted, and Buddhism evolved into something more of a religion, as various other speculative hypotheses became incorporated into its practical and ethical foundation. Because of this, the basic message of Buddhism becomes lost in mystification and hypothetical metaphysics. For instance, the Buddhist doctrines on karma and reincarnation invoke non-naturalistic processes and have no place in a modern rational philosophy of life.

**IV. What is to be Recognized or Preserved**

In the rest of this essay I would like to point out what these life philosophies should be recognized for — in regards to their contributions to secular ethics and philosophy (including natural philosophy, aka science) — and I would like to highlight the insights contained in them which are still relevant and worthy of integration into a modern philosophy of life, one that is grounded in the latest scientific evidence. It is possible to retain these insights while eschewing what is erroneous, speculative, or mystical. A modern philosophy of life should not only provide meaning and guidance, but also offer a secular alternative to the the increasingly serious existential threat posed by dogmatic religion and other worldviews which are not grounded in the [intersubjectivity](http://www.brianpellis.net/glossary/#intersubjectivity) that a rational view of the world provides. These insights from classical philosophy offer a wealth of aesthetic value, symbolism, tradition, and wisdom toward this end.

**V. Stoicism**

It is said that Stoicism got its start when Zeno of Citium (c. 334 — c. 262 BCE), a wealthy merchant, became shipwrecked on his way to sell a shipload of cargo. Finding himself stranded in Athens, Zeno had to start over virtually from the bottom, as all of his possessions were destroyed in this stroke of misfortune. In Athens Zeno met many philosophers and intellectuals, including Crates of Thebes, a Cynic philosopher who would become his primary influence. Eventually, around 300 BCE, Zeno started to develop his own school of thought and taught it on the Stoa Poikile (*stoa* = porch, *poikile* = varied or painted) — a colonnaded walkway and porch adorned with murals, paintings and relics in the Athenian Agora (market and gathering place). [Note: All origin information from Laertius & Hicks, 1925, pp. 109–113.]

Zeno’s philosophical movement was originally referred to as Zenoism, but later became known as Stoicism, in reference to the Stoa Poikile. Stoicism borrowed heavily from the Cynic views espoused by Crates (Cynicism being an earlier Greek school of philosophy founded by Antisthenes and popularized by the iconoclastic philosopher Diogenes of Sinope, aka Diogenes the Cynic or Diogenes the dog, around 380 BCE), in that both philosophies held virtue and living in accordance with man’s nature to be the highest aim, however, Zeno took a more [dialectical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic) or moderate approach to ethics than the austere minimalism and primitivism of Cynicism. [Note: see section on indifferents for more on the difference between Stoic and Cynic ethics below.]

**Stoic Precursors of Cognitive Psychotherapy: The Dichotomy of Control**

In life there are things which we have control over, and things which are outside of our control. The Stoics taught that it is wasted effort to focus on things which are outside of our control. For example, we cannot control what the weather will be like tomorrow, but we can control how we prepare for the weather. We could become anxious worrying that the streets will be icy tomorrow on our morning commute, or we could view this anxiety as pointless wasted energy and decide instead to use our mental energy coming up with ways to prepare or minimize the danger we might face. If we choose the latter — as Stoicism suggests — we will expend our energy toward preparedness, and not waste any additional energy worrying about those things outside of our control. The essence of the Stoic philosophy of life is that we should focus on those things we have control over — the most important of these being the beliefs we form (see Epictetus & Carter, 2012, para. 1).

It’s more realistic, however, to view the amount of control we possess in a situation as lying somewhere on a spectrum, rather than situated somewhere in a dichotomy of control vs. no control. On this view, there is one side of the spectrum where we have full control over some things, and another side where we have absolutely no control; the areas in between signify varying gradations of control.

A simplified example:

←full control — some control — virtually no control — absolutely no control →

On this Stoic-inspired spectrum of control we should waste no energy or worry on things which are on the far right of the spectrum, and focus on those things which are on the left side — those which we have some degree of control over; for those things in between we should focus on those aspects we can control, and disregard those aspects which we cannot. For example, you have very little influence over what people think about you — you can try to be a good person to the best of your ability (the limited degree of control you have), but someone may find you annoying, or stupid, or dislike you for a number of reasons, even irrational or superficial reasons; because of this, we should waste little time worrying about what others think of us when we feel we have done all we can to be someone worthy of friendship or respect. Instead, we should focus on doing the best we can to be a good, considerate, and likable person, so that we can foster lasting, healthy relationships with the people who *do* want to be a part of our lives. I believe a more nuanced view of control such as this is also more likely to engender a critical evaluation of our locus of control — that is, what we have control over in a given situation — rather than an over-simplistic general view that places too much emphasis on our ability to control things (internal locus of control) or our inability to control things (external locus of control).

**Stoic Precursors of Cognitive Psychotherapy: The Centrality of Beliefs**

As I stated in the section on the Stoic concept of the dichotomy of control, the main premise of Stoic psychology is that we have no control over what happens in the world, but we do have control over our mind, to the extent that we have control over the beliefs we form — which influence our emotions and behavior — and to the extent that we have control over how we choose to respond to our emotions (either assenting to them or overriding them). Stoicism, then, holds that our beliefs play a central role in our lives. Beliefs influence virtually everything about who we are: the thoughts we tend to have, the emotions or general attitudes we experience, and the behaviors we engage in. Epictetus, one of the early Stoics of the Roman era, put it best:

> “Men are disturbed, not by things, but by the principles and notions which they form concerning things” (The Enchiridion, c. 5).

For example, if we firmly and rigidly believe that it is unacceptable and horrible for someone to insult or dishonor us, then we will become angry if we believe someone has been disrespectful toward us. The anger we experience in response to a perceived affront could cloud our judgement to the point where we can no longer form an accurate interpretation of what has transpired — for example, we may think someone has *intentionally* acted in a disrespectful way toward us when this isn’t the case.

The Stoics believed that an insult alone, as with many other events on their own, can cause us no serious harm. In this example, it is the belief that it is horrible to be insulted, and that an affront to our honor must not be tolerated, which causes one to be angry or otherwise distressed — and which causes our emotional and behavioral responses. Under the influence of our belief that an insult is not to be tolerated, we become angry, and our resulting behavioral reactions may cause us serious harm (e.g., by damaging relationships, by suffering the consequences of engaging in violence, by suffering the harmful effects of stress, etc.). As Epictetus stated:

> “Remember that it is we who torment, we who make difficulties for ourselves — that is, our opinions do. What, for instance, does it mean to be insulted? Stand by a rock and insult it, and what have you accomplished? If someone responds to insult like a rock, what has the abuser gained with his invective?” (Discourses I, 25.28–29). [Note: This quote is a modernized translation found in Massimo Pigliucci’s article on the Stoic view of anger, however I have linked to the MIT classics online text that uses antiquated language.]

A simplified explanation of the Stoic view on beliefs: Event → Belief (our filter, how we interpret the event) → Response (emotional or behavioral response).

Because beliefs are so important, with so many implications for our behavior and our emotional states, the Stoics held that it is paramount that we carefully form our beliefs based on reason, rather than haphazardly, or lazily — such as by just blindly accepting what is considered “common sense”, or the views of the majority. The Stoics believed that carefully formed rational beliefs will prevent us from giving in to destructive emotions or emotional overreactions — what the Stoics called “passions”. The goal of Stoicism, then, is to teach one to engage in self-disputation — that is, to critically examine and question our own beliefs and amend them according to new evidence or information.

The Stoic view on the centrality of beliefs and the importance of avoiding succumbing to passions inspired the psychologist Albert Ellis to develop a form of psychotherapy he termed rational emotive behavioral therapy [REBT] (Ellis & Joffe-Ellis, 2011, p. 27). REBT is considered a highly philosophical form of psychotherapy, and it was the first form of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to be developed — CBT is one of the most widely used and empirically supported psychological treatments used in modern psychotherapy. REBT also focuses on teaching disputation and developing a tendency toward self-disputation (of irrational or ineffective beliefs) in the client.

**Stoic Precursors of Cognitive Psychotherapy: The Stoic View of Passions**

Passions, the Stoics believed, are often based on illogical presumptions about states of affairs, or possible future state of affairs, which are “indifferent” in themselves — that is, they are essentially of no consequence independent of our beliefs about them. Anger as a response to disrespect is a great example of a passion — in that it is an unnecessary and judgement-clouding response to a state of affairs which we find undesirable, but which has no effect on us if not for our belief that being disrespected is something to become angry about. The Stoics viewed anger as a type of transitory insanity (see: [Pigliucci, 2017](https://aeon.co/ideas/anger-is-temporary-madness-heres-how-to-avoid-the-triggers)) due to the way it impairs our ability to make good decisions, much like an intoxicant does. Even in situations that would seem to warrant anger, the Stoics would recommend against giving in to this exaggerated emotional response because of this intoxicating effect. Fear and anxiety that have spiraled out of control are further examples of passions, in that they represent energy wasted on worry that could have been directed toward rational preparation, or some other sort of action that affects what is in our control. [Note: I will discuss this more in the section below on the Stoic dichotomy of control (below). Also, there are parallels here to the distinction between neurotic anxiety and existential anxiety in existential philosophy; in a later article I will comment more on these.]

In agreement with the Stoic view, modern psychological counseling often utilizes the acronym HALT to help us remember to not act or engage in important decision making when we are hungry, angry, lonely, or tired; the Stoics would say to avoid acting or engaging in important decision making when we feel ourselves under the influence of any of the passions (e.g., envy, fear, hatred, anger, etc.). When we notice that we are under the influence of the passions we should distance ourselves from the situation until we can think rationally about it and come to clear-headed decisions. [Note: this advice should apply to non-metaphorical intoxicants as well.] Further, the Stoics thought we should examine the beliefs which we hold that have given rise to the passions we have experienced, since they felt that all such beliefs were in error.

Despite the colloquial use of the word “stoic” to be mean devoid of emotion, the Stoics did not teach that all emotion is to be suppressed. Stoicism holds that emotions instinctively arise (*propathos*) in response to certain events, and that we can train ourselves to use reason in deciding if we challenge these instinctual reactions or assent to them if they are worthy of experiencing/expressing. Destructive emotions (passions) are to be overriden through cognitive restructuring (adopting a more logical view of the situation), while positive emotions (*eupathos*) may be assented to. To reiterate this often misunderstood point, Stoicism only teaches us to avoid passions — that is, destructive emotions or emotional cascades of overreaction which have their origin in fallacious beliefs about the true nature of the world or what is important in life — not emotions in general. The Stoics believed that one may achieve a state of equanimity or psychological peace (*apatheia*) through avoiding the passions.

For a practical example of Stoic psychotherapy, consider that most people would prefer to possess enough wealth to be able to purchase luxury items (things such as amenities, entertainment, or fine food), however, not having these things is not cause for anger, and the prospect of losing these things is not cause for anxiety. Luxury items may make our lives easier or more pleasurable if they are put to the right use, but they are not necessary for a good life. It is understandable to be upset when we lose money that we could have put toward something we wanted to buy or do, however, it is not a catastrophe when circumstances prevent us from being able to afford these things. If one were to become angry or anxious over an actual or potential loss of wealth they would be succumbing to passion.

**Stoic Precursors of Cognitive Psychotherapy: Realistic Expectations**

The Stoics held that much of our psychological suffering stems from our false beliefs about the nature of life. An unrealistic view of life and the world leads to unrealistic expectations, and when these unrealistic expectations come up against the harshness of reality, we suffer. If we prepare for this reality, however, we will do much better to cope with it. The Stoics advocated preparing for the possibility of disaster, or failure, or hostility by contemplating these scenarios in advance — what they referred to as *premeditatio malorum* (modern Stoics call it “negative projection”). The Stoics also felt we should meditate on our mortality (*memento mori*), and those we are closest to, in order to remind us that we have a limited amount of time, and that we should live in such a way that takes this into account (Seneca & Costa, 2005, p. 1).

By having a view of reality that takes into consideration the fact that anything can happen — from the very good to the very worst — and preparing for the worst, we may harden ourselves against it if it does occur. Also, by taking the worst case scenario into consideration we can do what is in our power to prepare for it — both psychologically and practically (this is a point that surely resonates with survivalists and preppers). As the ancient Stoic Seneca stated:

> “For by looking ahead to all that may happen as though it were going to happen, he will soften the attacks of all ills, which bring nothing unforeseen to those who are prepared and expectant, but come as a serious blow to those who show no concern and expect only blessings” (Seneca, Davie, & Reinhardt, 2008, p. 130).

**Stoic Ethics: The Concept of Indifferents**

According to the Stoics, only virtue (wisdom, moderation, courage, and justice) held [intrinsic value](http://www.brianpellis.net/glossary/#intrinsic%20value) — everything else was only of [instrumental value](http://www.brianpellis.net/glossary/#instrumental%20value) (i.e., only valuable as a means to the intrinsically valuable — virtue) or completely unimportant. This might seem like a moralistic hyper-focus on virtue, but in comparison to its Cynic foundations — which held that we should only strive after virtue — this was a more moderate view because it incorporated the idea of “indifferents”. An indifferent is something which we may prefer (strive after) or disprefer (avoid), but which is ultimately not essential to living a good life. A classic example of a preferred indifferent is wealth — if used right it may be instrumental (helpful) to getting what is good in life, but it is not necessary or sufficient to living a good life; therefore experiencing passion regarding the loss of wealth is a cognitive error.

The concept of indifferents helps us to put things into perspective where we can use critical thinking to decide what is truly important in life, rather than passively or uncritically accepting the value system of the dominant culture (this could be the dominant culture of the society we live in, the subculture we belong to, of our family, of our religious community, etc.). A critical examination of our values allows us to categorize or rank what is valuable in terms of importance: utmost importance (intrinsically valuable or of necessary instrumental value), what is preferred but is not essential (preferred indifferent and/or of instrumental value), what should be disregarded or avoided but is unimportant (dispreferred indifferent), and what should be absolutely avoided (intrinsically disvaluable). When we develop such a perspective we can react more rationally or effectively to maximize what our critical examination has revealed to be truly important.

A modern philosophy of life should not be as rigid, in only signing intrinsic value to moral virtue, but it should adopt the idea that there are things which we may pursue or avoid, but which are ultimately non-essential when it comes to living the good life. For a modern and practical example of how Stoic insight can be incorporated into our lives consider Albert Ellis’ Stoic-inspired REBT — the most philosophical version of CBT — which teaches that we are likely to discover that most of our “musts” (beliefs about the way things *must* be) are really just “preferences or desires,” (what the Stoics would call preferred indifferents) rather than absolute necessities for living a good life (Ellis & Joffe-Ellis, 2011, pp. 40–41).

**Historical Contributions of Stoicism**

**Stoic Ethics: Moral Egalitarianism and Social Responsibility**

Due to the fact that Stoic metaphysics regarded God as [immanent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanence) they believed that all people are equals, in that they are all part of divinity. A corollary of this view is that all persons have equal [moral standing](http://www.brianpellis.net/glossary/#moral%20standing). Since the Stoics held that humans were social beings by nature, and since they advocated the virtue of justice, they consistently argued for social and political involvement. In fact, many of the revered Stoic forefathers were politicians and social reformers.

Stoic moral egalitarianism and social responsibility does not require a pantheistic basis, and these views are no longer controversial in the developed world — however, a modern philosophy of life that focuses on suffering has no scientific basis for limiting this focus to humans. I will discuss the case for moral sentiocentrism in section VII on Buddhism.

**VI. Epicureanism**

The historian of philosophy Diogenes Laertius states that Epicurus was born on the Greek island of Samos and came to Athens at the age of eighteen (Laertius & Hicks, 1925, pp. 529–531). According to Laertius he was introduced to philosophy at the age of fourteen and took a keen interest in the works of Democritus, one of the first philosophers to propose a metaphysical theory of [atomism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomism). Epicurus would go on to incorporate a version of atomism as the metaphysical foundation for his philosophy of life. It seems that Epicurus’ brand of atomic metaphysics was quasi-naturalistic, in that it was compartmental — it did not deny the existence of deities, but rather believed that they did not interfere with the world which humans inhabit (Obbink, 1989), leaving only a naturalistic account of the world which we directly experience.

Epicurus was regarded as a gentle, kind, and charismatic leader, and he gained many followers during his youthful travels, and in the Athens area, where he would become established. It was on the outskirts of Athens that Epicurus founded “The Garden”, a commune where he lived and contemplated philosophy with his followers.

The lasting contributions of Epicureanism are summarized best in the [tetrapharmakos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrapharmakos) (four part cure) — Epicurean philosopher Philodemus’ elegantly rendered statement of Epicurus’ first four principal doctrines: “do not fear the gods, do not fear death, what is good is easy to get, and what is bad is easy to endure” (quoted from the [IEP entry on the tetrapharmakos](https://www.iep.utm.edu/philodem/)). Stated in more detail — to include both Epicurus’ views and modern adaptations — these are:

1. **“Do not fear the gods.”** Epicurus observed that many people in his time feared retribution from the gods — either in life or in a supposed afterlife. Epicurus understood that this fear was a great source of anxiety, and that anxiety was the main obstacle in the way of the good life. However, Epicurus concluded that there was no good reason to worry about these things. Epicurus held that the gods were perfect beings which were far above worrying about human actions, and that they did not (or could not) interfere with human affairs. He also felt that they were not malevolent, since they were perfect in every way.

Whereas Epicurus felt we had no good reason to believe the gods were malevolent or prone to human emotions, such as vindictiveness, a modern version of this view would simply state that *there is no cogent reason to fear that which there is no evidence for* (e.g., gods, demons, Hell, spirits, etc.). Just because something cannot be proven to not exist, doesn’t mean there are good reasons to believe in it. For example, if someone stated there is an invisible person that speaks to them and only they can see this person, there would be no way for us to absolutely prove what they believed was not true, but that does not mean we should believe them.

Epicurus understood that a primary source of suffering (in the form of anxiety, dread, and worry) was the fear of things which we have no good reasons to believe in. There are many things which cannot be disproven or proven with absolute certainty (e.g., it cannot be proven that we do not live in a simulation, we cannot disprove the view that other people do not actually exist [solipsism], etc.), but that does not mean we have good reasons to believe these things. Modern epistemological views hold that all of our inductive knowledge is probabilistic, and never certain, but that something must meet a certain specific criteria to be considered probable enough to be considered as knowledge or as a fact. There is no current evidence that would lend probabilistic support to belief in supernatural entities. Further, many religious conceptions of a god or gods state certain things that about these supposed entities which can be shown to be false — either logically or empirically — and these conceptions can therefore be considered disproven, for all practical purposes.

2. **“Do not fear death.”** Again, Epicurus, in a manner similar to rational emotive behavioral therapy (REBT — a modern form of cognitive behavioral psychotherapy), is asking us to think critically about the beliefs we hold, since irrational beliefs can often lead to anxiety, worry, and maladaptive behaviors. Many people fear death because they hold beliefs such as that they will be punished in the afterlife for something they did (see #1 above), or because they are generally disturbed by a belief that conscious experience continues after death. Since Epicurus was an atomist he held a materialistic view of consciousness which accords with the physicalist axioms or operational definitions of modern science — that is, the view that consciousness is an emergent property that can arise from selectively organized physical matter (in this case the brain) — and that the death of the brain causes a cessation of consciousness. Epicurus stated:

> “Death, therefore, the most awful of evils, is nothing to us, seeing that, when we are, death is not come, and, when death is come, we are not” (Letter to Menoeceus).

Here, Epicurus is stating that death cannot be considered to be a harm, since there is no longer a subject of harm after we have died. This is known as [no subject of harm argument](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/death/#EpiChaDeaCanAffUs). A follower of Epicurus, [Lucretius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucretius), argues that when we are dead it is like before we were born, and since not existing before our birth was no harm to us, not existing after our death is also no harm to us. This is known as the [symmetry argument](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/death/#SymArg) against death as a harm.

Some may think this is a very cavalier way to think about death, in that it is just too dismissive of anxiety related to one’s death, or the often painful dying process (if it is protracted), but I think the ultimate point we can take away is that we often take something that could understandably be viewed as undesirable and make it much worse by attaching all sorts of unjustified beliefs to it. In contrast to a fearful view of death, one might consider the [view of death professed by philosopher Brian Tomasik](https://reducing-suffering.org/the-horror-of-suffering/#Example_Fear_of_death), or consider that [suffering associated with dying may not be as horrible as we imagine](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/finding-purpose/201811/facts-calm-your-fear-death-and-dying).

As we can see, parts one and two of the Epicurean tetrapharmakos are essentially admonishments to use reason and form one’s beliefs carefully. Doing so will allow us to avoid a great deal of anxiety — anxiety being the primary obstacle to living the good life according to Epicurus. We can see that there is significant overlap here between Epicureanism and Stoicism when we understand the tetrapharmakos in this way. Both Stoicism and Epicureanism teach that the use of reason can engender equanimity in the face of life’s most distressing existential questions and most difficult challenges. Epicurus believed that a view of the world that was grounded in reason allows us to be in a better place to know what is good and how to get it. Giving in to unfounded beliefs like fear of the gods only served to confuse people about how the world worked and how to attain the good.

3. **“What is good is easy to get.”** This statement describes a central aspect of the Epicurean view of flourishing — that what is truly good in life is not hard to attain. The Epicurean view is hedonistic — that is, it holds that the sole intrinsic good is pleasure — however, the Epicureans did not advocate an indiscriminate pursuit of pleasure. [Note: The Epicurean view of “pleasure” was the combination of freedom from psychological suffering (*ataraxia*) and physical suffering (*aponia)*. Epicurus believed that when one was completely free from suffering they experienced a profound sense of contentment and tranquility, or pleasure (Hicks, 1925, p. 657).] Rather, Epicurus recommended that we critically evaluate our desires in order to determine which are both *natural and necessary*, in other words, which are most likely to minimize suffering — and thereby increase pleasure — over one’s lifespan, and are worth pursuing as a means to satisfy a real need (Epicurus, Inwood, & Gerson, 1994, p. 30). **According to Epicurus, all we really need to live the good life** (minimize our suffering and maximize our pleasure) **is virtue** (i.e., prudence, honor, and justice; see Hicks, 1925, p. 657)**, friendship, freedom, and philosophy**. [Note: Epicurus’ list prefigures the psychologist [Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs).] For Epicurus, all of these things are [necessary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessity_and_sufficiency) [instrumental goods](http://www.brianpellis.net/glossary/#instrumental%20value), while pleasure (or the absence of suffering) is the only intrinsic good.]

Epicurus understood that an imprudent lifestyle of overindulgence in some pleasurable things was problematic for a number of reasons (e.g., it was contrary to the virtues [see the section on virtue below]; it increased one’s desire for, and dependence on, the source of pleasure; it lead to a loss of self-sufficiency [which is necessary for freedom]; etc.). Because of this the Epicureans practiced moderation in their consumption habits — for example, they did not drink to excess, or regularly eat fine foods (Epicurus, Inwood, & Gerson, 1994, pp. 30–31). With this view of pleasure in mind, and the necessary instrumental goods needed to achieve it (virtue, friendship, freedom, philosophy), we don’t need a lot of money, and we don’t need to get bogged down in futile or overly ambitious pursuits, like chasing after fame and fortune, or desperately trying to save the world. [Note: the ancient Greek [Cyrenaics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrenaics) were also ethical hedonists, and they seem to have advocated a less moderate view of pleasure satisfaction.]

This insight prefigures the more modern and empirically supported concept of the “[hedonic treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill)” in psychology — that is, the tendency to return to a life-long stable “hedonic setpoint”, regardless of how much pleasure seeking we engage in, or the positive life changes we experience (with regard to negatively [valenced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(psychology)) events as well). More recent research into the hedonic treadmill supports a nuanced view, where various setpoints related to hedonic tone can shift over time in response to certain practices (see Diener, Lucas, & Scollon, 2006, p. 312). It seems that temporarily raising our hedonic tone (such as with euphoriant drugs) might lower our hedonic setpoint, either biochemically — through receptor exhaustion, recalibration (upregulation or downregulation), or neurotransmitter depletion — or psychologically — by making comparisons from our setpoint to the drug-induced peak state. Epicurus seems to have intuitively grasped this by pointing out that we do not gain anything lasting from ravenously going after pleasurable things, and we are likely to complicate our lives and add stressors that will prevent us from positively affecting our overall life satisfaction; instead he advocated developing an appreciation for what we have, limiting our desires to simple or moderate pleasures, and living a communal life of mutual kindness with friends. These are prescriptions for increasing our happiness and sustaining it which the evidence seems to support (see Diener, Lucas, & Scollon, 2006, p. 312).

What is Good is Easy to Get: On Freedom

Epicurus believed the best way to attain freedom was through self-sufficiency, and he felt the best way to achieve self-sufficiency was through prudent moderation of desire satisfaction (also curtailing excessive desire), and through a simple existence. Moderation and simplicity are seen as important since requiring very little meant that one could easily attain self-sufficiency, which is required for freedom (Epicurus, Inwood, & Gerson, 1994, p. 30 & p. 39–40). The less one desires, the easier it is for them to get what will make them content, and the more they will enjoy luxuries when they are available and one finds it prudent to enjoy them (Epicurus, Inwood, & Gerson, 1994, p. 30 & p. 39).

What is Good is Easy to Get: On Friendship and Freedom

For Epicureans, communal living with like minded friends was seen as the best way to self-sufficiency and to having good relationships with friends. Epicurus stated:

> “A free life cannot acquire great wealth, because the task is not easy without slavery to the mob or those in power; rather, it already possesses everything in constant abundance. And if it does somehow achieve great wealth, one could easily share this out in order to obtain the good will of one’s neighbors” (Epicurus, Inwood, & Gerson, 1994, p. 39).

Working and living together meant that one could avoid the loneliness of the traditional life, and the alienation of selling one’s labor, or the products of one’s labor, in an impersonal or unfulfilling manner that was disconnected to any sense of community (what we might refer to as “wage slavery” in the modern world). Epicurus advocated a community of affinity or friendship, based on both selfish — friends increase our pleasure and offer protection — and altruistic motives — one loves their friends as one loves themselves, and has their interests in mind just as much as his or her own (Epicurus, Inwood, & Gerson, 1994, pp. 37–39). It can be convincingly argued that this sense of community, or even simple friendship for many people (especially later in life, and in many toxic or controlling relationships), is what is missing from most of our lives in contemporary society; and that it is this lack of a loving community — this alienation from one another — that leads to, or at least contributes to, a lot of the mental illness we find in society. Evidence from a [longitudinal study on happiness](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/over-nearly-80-years-harvard-study-has-been-showing-how-to-live-a-healthy-and-happy-life/) bolsters this view that friendship is an essential component of lasting contentment.

The communal aspect of Epicureanism receives a great deal of criticism because Epicurus recommended that his followers steer clear of involvement in politics if they wanted to live the good life. Epicurean communalism, therefore, is seen as an unethical sort of isolationism (i.e., shirking one’s duty to justice). This view is often conflated with an Epicurean disregard for social justice, but I would argue that this is charge may be unfair (especially considering that not all of Epicurus’ writing survived to modernity). Disengagement from what was likely an ineffective involvement in political strife — which carried the possibility of deadly consequences — does not preclude working toward social justice on other fronts (e.g., through cultural change). As I argued earlier, dropping out of a corrupt system, and living a life that presents an example of justice, might be the most effective and least self-destructive way to attack a socioeconomic system that is beyond actionable reform.

Our modern world is undoubtedly more humane on some fronts (perhaps even more brutal on some, in terms of sheer scale; for example see [factory farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_animal_farming)), but even today’s movements for social justice appear to largely be exercises in futility, given the fact that many injustices have systemic roots in the socio-economic system, and in more [distal terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximate_and_ultimate_causation), in our evolved psychology (that we are mostly powerless to change at this point in time). Proponents of a modern secular philosophy of life that focuses on justice and alleviating suffering could very well benefit from a form of communalism — especially given the fact that the means of distributing information are much more available today. Presenting, through various forms of media, what a just society might look like, and proposing plans for its implementation on a mass scale should be some of the central tasks of such a movement, and a commune is one possible way of demonstrating this — while also allowing for valuable experimentation on ways to live together, achieve justice, and diminish suffering.

What is Good is Easy to Get: On Virtue

Epicurus believed that it was impossible to live the good life without living virtuously (Epicurus, Inwood, & Gerson, 1994, p. 31). Epicurus’ ethical theory is hard to pin down; it seems he was both an ethical hedonist and a virtue ethicist in his conception of personal ethics, and a contractarian in his view of social ethics or justice. He did not view actions as right or wrong in the absolute sense, but within a context of implicit or explicit contractual relations. He used a form of [enlightened self-interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightened_self-interest) to argue that we should never do anything that we would be afraid of getting caught doing — since we can never know for sure if we will get caught (Epicurus, Inwood, & Gerson, 1994, p. 39). On this view it isn’t that an action is wrong, in a metaphysical sense, but that it violates a contract of acceptable behavior within society, and going against this contract would also go against our self-interest by causing anxiety for the offender since it could result in reprisal by victims or punishment by authorities. Since Epicureans viewed anxiety as one of the main obstacles to the good life, non-virtuous behavior — as a likely cause of anxiety — was to be be shunned. [Note: Epicurus did not address the [Ring of Gyges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Gyges) counter to this meta-ethical view in any of the extant writings.]

Other Historical Contributions

Like the Stoics, Epicureans were egalitarians — allowing women and persons from all social classes into their communities. The egalitarian views of Epicureanism stemmed from their naturalistic metaphysics — put very simply, the view that we are all just atoms, and therefore there can be no objective claim to superiority (in terms of moral standing or value). Today, we can base our egalitarianism on more than metaphysics, such as a [sentientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentientism) theory of moral standing, and principles of fairness, but our modern egalitarianism owes a debt of gratitude to the Epicureans.

What is Good is Easy to Get: Philosophy

Epicurus clearly held philosophy in high regard, and valued it as a means to the good. He believed it was contemplation of philosophy that could show us how to achieve the good life (for instance, by allowing us to critically think about what things should be pursued for our long-term well-being); and how to escape our irrational anxieties about life and death. Most people living the modern “rat race” can’t devote themselves to a life of philosophizing, but teaching [critical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking) at an early age in public schools would surely be a step in the right direction of providing the tools for this kind of practical insight.

4. **“What is bad is easy to endure.”** Epicurus stated that pain was usually severe and short in duration (acute, in modern terms), or mild and long in duration (chronic, in modern terms); pain that was both severe and long-lasting was extremely rare. Given his belief in the rarity of this sort of pain, the philosopher did not feel that dread and worry over it was warranted. Epicurus recommended meditating on pleasures from one’s past and on the temporary nature of suffering (its cessation in death, in the absolute worst forms) in order to cope with intense suffering ([Sedley, 2018](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lucretius/#Eth)).

This seems to be the least persuasive of the principal Epicurean doctrines. Although it seems that reason may engender an equanimity that may mitigate a psychological exacerbation of suffering, it doesn’t seem clear that this makes suffering “easy to endure.” This is why modern [suffering abolitionists](https://www.abolitionist.com/) focus on solutions that are more pragmatic for the common person, applicable to other species, and which would be more effective when fully developed (e.g., genetic therapies, neural “re-wiring”, and pharmacological interventions [as crude as these may currently be; see [The Good Drug Guide](https://www.biopsychiatry.com/)]).

**Stoicism vs. Epicureanism: Prefiguring the Modern Debate over Ethics**

The Stoics and Epicureans were bitter rivals in the ancient world. There are some parallels between the ancient feud between Epicureans and Stoics, and the modern debates in ethical philosophy between [utilitarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) (or other forms of consequentialism) and proponents of duty/virtue ethics. It can be argued that Epicureanism ultimately inspired utilitarianism (see Scarre, 1994), and the Stoics would inspire, in many ways, modern [virtue ethics](https://www.iep.utm.edu/virtue/) and [deontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontological_ethics). Epicurus, like modern utilitarians, believed that a singular intrinsic goodness can be defined and sought out, while proponents of duty or virtue ethics propose that aiming at such ends (ethical teleology) is problematic for a number of reasons — rather, they believe we should not aim toward any particular end, but live by certain duties or virtues (this is an oversimplified sketch of the debate between these views for the purpose of illustration).

I feel like the best way to reconcile these opposing ways of looking at ethics, is to leave the ultimate questions aside, for debate, but to adopt a philosophically grounded ethical pluralism for pragmatic purposes. An example of this approach can be found in the [effective altruism movement](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) — which despite leaning strongly toward utilitarianism (in terms of affiliation) is open to persons of any ethical orientation. A modern philosophy of life would do well to include duties associated with virtue or [deontological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontological_ethics) views, along with happiness maximization/suffering minimization in a pluralistic conception of the good, instead of treating either of these as the sole intrinsic good. For instance, our conception of the good — for the purposes of a multi-tendency organization — can include things such as a duty to justice or fairness, along with a duty to increase happiness or desire satisfaction and reduce or abolish suffering; a certain way of living would follow from, or be entailed by, this conception, but one would not be obligated to adopt this view on a personal level (for an example of this view see [W.D. Ross’s What Makes Right Actions Right](https://spot.colorado.edu/~heathwoo/readings/ross.pdf)). A more broad approach would simply advocate an ethical pluralism that shares a general conception of justice that can be envisioned using *idealized procedures* — that is, rational processes or thought experiments designed to arrive at an [intersubjective](http://www.brianpellis.net/glossary/#intersubjectivity) conception of justice (e.g., Rawls’ [“veil of ignorance”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance), etc.) — even if one does not adopt a Rawlsian theory of ethics.

**VII. Buddhism**

Preface: It is difficult to write definitively on Buddhism, since there is no singular “Buddhism”, nor any universally agreed upon translations or interpretations of the Buddhist textual canon. For this reason, I have relied heavily on a general interpretation of Buddhism that attempts to distill a core of common beliefs from disparate views.

Buddhism, as a loose family of views, is based on the teachings of Siddhārtha Gautama, a man who lived and taught in India around the 6th century BCE. According to Buddhist tradition, Gautama was born into a royal family (the Shakya clan) and was sheltered from the world in a life of luxury. During travels outside the palace grounds Gautama experienced a series of realizations about suffering and death (i.e., the 4 sights: seeing an old person, a sick person, a corpse, and an ascetic). After these realizations, Gautama, at the age of 29, went on an ascetic spiritual journey where he came to further conclusions, such as, the need for a *middle path* of spirituality (between asceticism and sensuousness, i.e., the Noble Eightfold Path), and the role of meditation in awakening oneself to reality.

Buddhists refer to Gautama as the Buddha, a title Buddha meaning “the Awakened One”; Gautama did not claim to be a deity or a saint, he only claimed that he had “awakened” from the dream-like consciousness which he believed characterized human experience (Smith, 2009, p. 82). Religious Buddhists (as opposed to [secular Buddhists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_Buddhism)) believe Gautama became fully enlightened or attained *moksha* —that is, liberation from *Samsara,* the cycle of life, death, and rebirth; the term moksha also entails reaching *nirvana* — total equanimity, the end of suffering, or the final goal of Buddhism (Smith, 2009, p. 82).

The core of Gautama Buddha’s teachings are referred to as the Four Noble Truths, and the Eightfold Path. The Four Noble Truths, as explained by Smith (2009, pp. 101–103), are as follows (in a very abbreviated and simplified form):

1) To live is to experience *dukkha* (suffering).

2) The cause of suffering is *tanha* (selfish desire or craving).

3) The cure for suffering is the cessation of selfish desire.

4) Selfish desire can be overcome through the Noble Eightfold Path.

The Noble Eightfold Path, according to Smith (2009, pp. 104–112), is as follows (again, adapted here in a very simplified and abbreviated form):

1) Right View — beliefs (and their attendant actions) have consequences in this life and in our lives to come (karma/reincarnation), and in each life we will be condemned to suffer unless we achieve *moksha* (enlightenment and liberation from the cycle of death, rebirth, and suffering); in essence, to have the right views is to be constantly mindful of the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path.

2) Right Intent — focus on the goal of enlightenment and liberation.

3) Right Speech — speak the truth, and speak with compassion (be charitable and kind in speech).

4) Right Conduct — our actions have consequences in this life and in lives to come. “Do not kill [any sentient beings…]. Do not steal […]. Do not lie […]. Do not be unchaste […]. Do not drink intoxicants […]” (Smith, 2009, p. 108).

5) Right Livelihood — do not engage in occupations that go against the Noble Eightfold Path.

6) Right Effort — steady determined effort or will is necessary on the Noble Eightfold Path.

7) Right Mindfulness — become aware of the transitory nature of thoughts, moods, emotions, and sensations; train the mind to “control the senses and impulses, rather than being driven by them” (Smith, 2009, p. 110).

8) Right Concentration — earnest intention to focus the mind on what is good and necessary.

Practice 1 of the Noble Eightfold Path pertains to Buddhist metaphysics (and how it corresponds to Buddhist ethics), and practices 2 through 5 explain Buddhist ethics based on the principal of *ahimsa*— or adherence to not using aggressive violence and the avoidance of causing harm. Practices 6 through 8 are instructive on the Buddhist concept of mindfulness and acceptance. The Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path represent Gautama’s view of the moral primacy of suffering and his plan for liberation from suffering — that is, the elimination of desire or craving.

This focus on desire’s connection to suffering is something that Buddhism, Stoicism, and Epicureanism all share, however, their approach is different: Buddhism suggests the complete elimination of desire, while Stoicism and Epicureanism hold that we should use reason to temper our desires and to selectively assent only to those desires which are worth pursuing (with Buddhism and Epicureanism disagreeing, to an extent, on which desires we should assent to).

**Buddhist Mindfulness**

Buddhist mindfulness teaches that thoughts, emotions, and sensations are transitory things that occur in the mind and then pass. Instead of immediately and reflexively reacting to thoughts, the practitioner is instructed to accept them without passing judgement, and to simply observe them as they arise in our mind. Mindfulness, then, could be seen as a form of psychotherapy that provides instruction on developing metacognitive awareness or metacognition — that is, an awareness of one’s own thoughts and emotions. Such an awareness can allow the individual to learn to regulate their internal mental states with a “higher” [cognitive module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_module) that is rational and intentional, rather than reflexive (what the Stoics called the *[hêgemonikon](https://www.iep.utm.edu/stoicmind/#SH2d)*). This aspect of Buddhism partially inspired at least one form of CBT (see Ellis & Joffe-Ellis, 2011, p. 14), and could be considered a form of *decentering* or *cognitive distancing,* also called *cognitive defusion* (see Bernstein et al., 2015) that is used in modern psychotherapies, such as [mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness-based_cognitive_therapy) [or [third wave CBT](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5608815/) in general], [metacognitive therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacognitive_therapy) (MCT), and [acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_and_commitment_therapy).

Similarly to Buddhist mindfulness, modern psychotherapies that utilize decentering or cognitive distancing advocate stepping back, or “distancing” oneself from their stream of thoughts and emotions for the purposes of observation and critical reflection. In other words the terms *decentering* or *distancing* serve as metaphors for switching into a mode of metacognitive awareness of one’s own thoughts (such as by an outside or overhead observer). These therapies elucidate the therapeutic value of mindfulness by eschewing any trappings of mysticism and by using more precise language to focus on training clients to A) develop metaconsciousness or meta-awareness (awareness of one’s own thought processes); B) not identify with their thoughts (e.g., to not believe that because you had thought X you are *insert label for person associated with X*, or because you had thought X, which you view negatively, then you are a bad person); and C) reduce the tendency to automatically or non-critically react to one’s thoughts, emotions, or emotional states (moods) [see Bernstein et al., 2015]. Both Buddhist mindfulness and modern psychotherapeutic mindfulness teach us to allow our rational faculties to modulate our behavioral and emotional reactions through critical reasoning (right concentration in Buddhism, and a critical evaluation of one’s beliefs and values in modern psychotherapy).

**Buddhist Existential Realism**

In contrast to classical Stoicism, which says that lasting equanimity can be found in living in accordance with our *nature* as rational and social beings, or Epicureanism, which holds that suffering can be eliminated through acquiring the necessary and *natural* things that are required to live the good life, Buddhism does not possess an actual or aesthetic element that views what is “natural” as somehow connected to the good; rather, Buddhism holds that the natural state for all sentient beings is suffering — a state which we must be liberated from. Such a view of the world appears to be pessimistic, for example, in contrast to the classical Stoic view that espouses belief in a volitional teleology — that is, a pantheistic intelligence that is often assumed to be benevolently guiding us toward some inscrutable, but ultimately good, end. In the terms of modern rationalism, however, the Buddhist view of reality is simply a form of naturalistic realism that refuses to propose untestable or unfalsifiable teleological hypotheses, and which does not shy away from the fact of ubiquitous suffering.

However, a more critical examination shows that the ancient Stoic view is hardly benevolent; rather, ancient Stoicism posits the existence of an entity that is completely indifferent to the individual beings within itself. Buddhism, on the other hand, holds that benevolence can only come from the mind of an individual who becomes aware that they are not separate or different, in any philosophically meaningful sense, from the [fellow sufferers](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/150016-the-conviction-that-the-world-and-therefore-man-too-is) of existence. So, while Buddhism could be seen as existentially pessimistic in one sense, in another sense it seems to offer a tangible hope for a better world that does not commit the [naturalistic fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy). Additionally, the Buddhist view which calls for the individual to strive for liberation, rather than striving for acquiescence to a divine will, as in classical Stoicism, makes the Buddhist much less susceptible to status quo bias rationalization — that is, the view that things are the way they are for some good reason. This makes the neo-Buddhist or secular Buddhist life philosophy much more amenable to modern suffering [abolitionism](https://www.abolitionist.com/).

**Buddhist Sentiocentrism**

Buddhism also differs from Stoicism and Epicureanism in its widening of the sphere of moral concern — beyond what some have seen as the [ethical egoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_egoism) or affinity-based tribalism of Epicureanism, and the [anthropocentrism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropocentrism) of Stoicism, to [sentiocentrism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiocentrism). Gautama held that non-human animals were sentient, to varying degrees (Getz, 2004, as cited in Finnigan, 2017), and instructed his followers to not kill them. This prohibition against killing was codified in the first of the [five Buddhist ethical precepts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_precepts), which are laid out in the fourth teaching of the Noble Eightfold Path. Buddhism, in many ways prefigures modern [Sentientism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentientism), since it views sentience as occurring on a gradient.

Modern suffering [abolitionism](https://www.abolitionist.com/) follows in this tradition, as it is also based on a sentiocentric or sentientist theory of moral standing. Modern suffering abolitionism, however, usually references the more recent, and more philosophically developed arguments from within the utilitarian school of ethical philosophy. One such argument for sentiocentrism comes from the utilitarian philosopher Peter Singer (2011, p. 50), who argued that if we hold suffering to be of high moral significance, then any sentient entity — that is, any entity capable of suffering — deserves to have their interests taken into consideration. The utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham was one of the first modern philosophers to [explicitly argue for the centrality of sentience](https://www.utilitarianism.com/jeremybentham.html) in ethics. Bentham stated that the question of moral standing should center on the capacity for experiencing suffering — rather than any other quality, such as intelligence or species membership.

**Buddhist Abolitionism**

The Buddhist view, which highlights the pervasiveness of suffering in the world, and the lack of any discernible purpose of this suffering (see the [Parable of the Poison Arrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Poisoned_Arrow)), also proposes a solution that would negate the natural order of perpetual reproduction and competition, and the corollary of perpetual suffering wherever biology happens to arise in the universe (a metaphorical *Samsara*). Regardless of whether one views the ideas of karma and reincarnation as literal, or metaphorical (as secular Buddhists do), what Gautama envisioned was total liberation — a way out of this endless cycle of suffering. Most modern suffering abolitionists will likely find the Buddhist solution to suffering to be inadequate (i.e., the extinguishment of desire), however, they are like to agree that Buddhism could be considered the first sentiocentric suffering [abolitionist](https://www.abolitionist.com/) life philosophy.

The moral significance of suffering which Gautama was aware of, still invokes the moral imperative to aid and relieve those who are suffering. As anyone who is currently experiencing intense involuntary suffering will likely attest — there is nothing more pressing than its cessation. As [abolitionist](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Abolitionism) philosopher [David Pearce argues](https://www.hedweb.com/abolitionist-project/index.html):

> “[…]let’s say I find myself in agony because my hand is on a hot stove. That agony is intrinsically motivating [emphasis mine], even if my conviction that I ought to withdraw my hand doesn’t follow the formal canons of logical inference.”

In other words, when one’s hand is being burnt there is no logical argument required to convince someone that they should remove their hand from the stove that is burning it. Pearce holds that unless we are content to go against the scientific and moral case for considering the interests of others, the suffering of others should matter just as much as our own. Put simply, our internal motivation to treat intense suffering as the most pressing matter in our own lives should also be externally motivating — that is, we should treat the intense suffering of others as the most pressing moral matter in the universe.

The moral significance of intense suffering is even more salient when we consider that it is ubiquitous. The philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer said that if we could grasp the amount of suffering on our planet, the sheer horror of this realization would make us wish for it to be as lifeless as the Moon (Schopenhauer, 2004, p. 19). Rather than taking the view of [efilism](https://efilism.fandom.com/wiki/Efilism_Wiki) or strict [antinatalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinatalism), which Schopenhauer seems to hint at here, most suffering abolitionists hold that suffering creates an urgent moral obligation to relieve or eliminate those conditions which allow for it, and to do so in a way that takes a consideration of interests into account — thereby precluding interventions that would go against the most basic interests of those involved.

The utilitarian philosopher Peter Singer (2011) has articulated the following argument for sentiocentrism:

> “The capacity for suffering and enjoying things is a prerequisite for having interests at all, a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests in any meaningful way. It would be nonsense to say that it was not in the interests of a stone to be kicked along the road by a child. A stone does not have interests because it cannot suffer. Nothing that we can do to it could possibly make any difference to its welfare. A mouse, on the other hand, does have an interest in not being tormented, because mice will suffer if they are treated in this way. If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that the suffering be counted equally with the like suffering — in so far as rough comparisons can be made — of any other being. If a being is not capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness, there is nothing to be taken into account. This is why the limit of sentience […] is the only defensible boundary of concern for the interests of others” (p. 50).

A modern rational philosophy of life must accept the preponderance of [scientific evidence for animal consciousness and sentience](http://fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdf), and the fact that, on a sentiocentric view, there is no morally relevant difference between humans and non-humans — in terms of qualifying for a degree of moral status (aka moral standing) that would confer legal and moral obligations to prevent unnecessary or involuntary suffering.

**VIII. Conclusion**

The contributions of Stoicism, Epicureanism, and Buddhism have been surpassed by those made by modern science and ethical philosophy (e.g., negative utilitarianism, negative [prioritarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prioritarianism), [duty pluralism](https://www.iep.utm.edu/ross-wd/), etc.), however, it is important to recognize the antecedents of these modern views, and to highlight the lasting practical, ethical, and existential insights that these ancient philosophies still offer. These lasting contributions can be integrated into a modern sentiocentric and suffering alleviation focused philosophy of life.

Stoic, Epicurean, and Buddhist ideas developed out of traditions that were grappling with practical, moral, and existential questions for centuries — without utilizing the trope common to theistic religions of inserting supposed revealed instruction from an all-knowing personal deity. Because these philosophical schools of thought took a more [naturalistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysical_naturalism) approach, their best insights (i.e., what has withstood scrutiny and the test of time) are not only still relevant, but also extremely valuable to a modern secular philosophy of life. Stoicism, for instance, offers an emphasis on the moral importance of virtue, the corresponding duties to work for social justice, and a practical, time-tested, and inspirational model of cognitive regulation of behavior and affect that has influenced modern forms of evidence-based [cognitive behavioral therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy) (CBT); Epicureanism, as a rational or sustainable approach to ethical hedonism partly inspired modern utilitarianism, and the Epicurean emphasis on the importance of communal living might be an important strategy toward social change; lastly, what Buddhism contributes is a model of cognitive distancing (used in modern mindfulness or metacognitive approaches to psychotherapy), and a strong emphasis on [sentiocentric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiocentrism) suffering abolition.

The ultimate question then, is how we might integrate these contributions into a coherent philosophy of life, rather than haphazardly throwing them together into a sloppy eclecticism. To avoid creating such an incoherent hodgepodge of ideas we have to look at how these insights might be [synthesized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis,_antithesis,_synthesis) into a coherent view. Fortunately, the best insights of these life philosophies are not mutually exclusive — that is, unless one becomes overly rigid or dogmatic in their theoretical view of flourishing. When a more fluid view is adopted the best insights of these life philosophies can complement one another. For instance, Stoicism’s cognitive regulation strategy that focuses on *disputation* synthesizes well with the Buddhist model that focuses on *cognitive distancing* or *decentering* (see [Donald Robertson’s excellent article on this topic](https://donaldrobertson.name/2013/01/18/cognitive-distancing-in-stoicism/)). Also, the Epicurean emphasis on establishing a community or communalism — where one lives a lifestyle that aims to eliminate suffering through living freely, virtuously, with friends that one loves, and in pursuit of wisdom/knowledge — can be synthesized with a Stoic emphasis on our duty to justice, so that this ideal becomes both a personal aim and an aim for human society as whole; this synthesis might present new strategies of working toward justice while avoiding the trap of getting bogged down in futility and the deleterious effects of directly living in the alienating structure of a toxic culture.

Buddhism adds a naturalistic consideration of moral status to this rough synthesis by grounding moral status in sentience, rather than an unjustifiable anthropocentrism (given a modern scientific understanding of neurophysiology). This view widens our sphere of concern to all sentient beings, and provides an inspiring vision of suffering abolition. The Buddhist emphasis on liberation from suffering also adds a strong existentialist element by providing a noble purpose for one’s life — to alleviate suffering in the world.

A secular life philosophy that focuses on suffering alleviation — which I have only hinted at here — would benefit greatly from incorporating what is time-tested, morally cogent, and logically sound in these ancient traditions. Such a life philosophy represents a possible option to fill the void that exists for non-religious individuals who are committed to a suffering-focused view of ethics.
